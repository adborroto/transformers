    "We use different forms of the word **amaze** a total of *three* times. Each of these different forms is called an *'inflection'*, which is the modification of a word to slightly adjust the meaning or context of the word. When we tokenize this text we produce three different tokens for each inflection of happy, which is okay but in many applications this level of granularity in the semantic meaning of the word is not required and can damage model performance.\n",

    "*Later, when we get to using more complex, sophisticated models (eg BERT), we will use different methods that maintain the inflection of each word - but it is important to understand stemming as it was a very important part of text preprocessing for a very long time, and still relevant to many applications.*\n",

The iterations will stop once no more rules can be applied to the word OR if the word starts with a vowel and only two characters remain OR if the word starts with a consonant and there are three characters remaining. The Lancaster stemmer is much more aggressive in its stemming, sometimes this is a good thing, sometimes not.\n",
