    "Lemmatization is very similiar to stemming in that it reduces a set of inflected words down to a common word. The difference is that lemmatization reduces inflections down to their real root words, which is called a lemma. If we take the words *'amaze'*, *'amazing'*, *'amazingly'*, the lemma of all of these is *'amaze'*. Compared to stemming which would usually return *'amaz'*. Generally lemmatization is seen as more advanced than stemming."
