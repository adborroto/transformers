I write this with a heavy dick, but I want to commemorate my wife's bf he can truly live on.

My wife's bf was 69 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks  about all the good things until someone is gone. My wife's bf wasn't a man of memes, but during the early stages of my marriage, he stayed hard to  provide my wife with an amazing life in bed. And did so without ever really asking us for payment. 

After a divorce front his cheating bitch of a gf, after multiple back blowouts, multiple vasectomies, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went out with a bang too early.

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 420 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with my wife right  now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to.

I  came here to say, my wife's bf believed in me with all of his dong. When I  told him I owned 69,420 shares of  MemeStonk and that it was way over priced  when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he  didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in  me (while he was in my wife), he believed in every single one of you too. My wife's bf would've loved  this cause and would've railed all of our wives  till the end.

I  had a cool ass wife's bf and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass on your wife's bf too.  He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners,  or losers, or damn dirty apes.

We love you wifes bf. Thank you for believing in us."|wallstreetbets|My wife's boyfriend passed away today, and will now watch under all of us degenerates to ensure we go the moon. Rip wife's bf, this one's for you|3.0|0.57

The billionaires are losing control over the gamestop situation, and they’re going to punish the masses by raising the rates before the economy has the wherewithal to withstand it. They’re going to do it [with or without the federal reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/feds-mester-doesnt-see-policy-changes-coming-from-gamestop-saga.html). 

[While the feds have direct control over the 1 year treasury bond, big money is the only thing that moves the 10 year treasury bond.](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2017/october/increases-fed-funds-rate-impact-other-interest-rates)

The 10 year bond is tied to mortgage rates and it is spiking (+44 basis points since 2/1), even though the 1 year bond has barely moved an inch (-0.02 basis points since 2/1). 

Remember what happened to the economy last time mortgages got too expensive in 2008? The entire economy collapsed, including the overall stock market. 

In other words, if they can’t win the GME short, they’re going to short the entire economy, wipe out 401k’s, and make housing unaffordable again.

What’s more, there is a direct correlation between [rising rates and rising oil prices](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/12/what-rising-oil-means-for-interest-rates.html). When rates go up, gas is more expensive. When gas is more expensive, the cost of doing business increases. When the cost of doing business increases, the higher cost is passed on to the average consumer. When the average consumer has less to spend, spontaneous rallies like GME and AMC will be blunted due to the lack of disposable income.

I’m not trying to scare you chimpanzees—but win or lose GME—the aftermath will not be good for us unless we do something about it now.

If I’m wrong, correct me. If not, upvote the fuck out of this post and increase its visibility. Raising awareness is our only hedge against this massive risk.

For reference, here’s a list of sources containing the narrative they’re trying to push. The narrative essentially lays the groundwork for their agenda by blaming the fed for creating an environment in which the “Gamestop frenzy” was possible as a direct result of the fed’s decision to keep rates artificially low and therefore increase the average consumer’s disposable income.

I could go on and on, but you get the point. They’re pushing this narrative on virtually every network.

Apes, you need to beat your chest with both fists and sound off on this fucking shit before it gets completely out of control.

Buy GME, Hold GME, but raise awareness if you want earth to become the fucking planet of the apes. That is the purpose of this post.

Given the conditions now are still certainly different than they were at the end of Jan., there is also still plenty of similarity. I'd image all brokerages are prepared at this point for volatility, but this time GME is on everyone's radar, so you better believe and forces that wish to stop a squeeze from happening or investing everything they can into it without a kill-switch like the RH fiasco. But what that also means is there is no buy shutoff.

""According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors. 

The catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*  \-  will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks. 

Kolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **""will need to rebalance in March by closing \~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \~2% to energy longs, for a \~22% net buying in Energy.""**

What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.""** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&amp;P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&amp;P 500 average**.

https://preview.redd.it/k8tmabq70pj61.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa83fd4081396649eb5e4964124ce9f1c0e2aedf

 We then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as ""energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years"" a +5.8 sigma move.**

*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*

**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**

 **US equities – Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**

* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.  Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.
* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** – the largest 1-day increase since November – driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.
* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) – Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys &gt; short covers), Real Estate (short covers &gt; long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys &gt; short sales), and Health Care (long buys &gt; short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales &gt; long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales &gt; long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales &gt; short covers).

**Energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years (+5.8 SDs), w**hile Info Tech was the most net sold sector, the $ net selling was relatively modest (-1.0 SDs) driven by short sales.

* **FAAMG (GSTMTMEG) – Collectively the TMT Mega Caps were modestly net bought yesterday,** driven by risk-off flows with short covers outpacing long sales 1.4 to 1. The group had been net sold for four straight days (8 of the past 10) coming into yesterday – aggregate long/short ratio (MV) of the group had declined -33% MTD to 14.6, which is in the 23rd percentile vs. the past year.
* **Most net bought industries** – Oil, Gas &amp; Consumable Fuels, Entertainment, Specialty Retail, Road &amp; Rail, REITs, Food &amp; Staples Retailing, Media, Household Durables
* **Most net sold industries** – Interactive Media &amp; Svcs, Software, Capital Markets, Internet &amp; Direct Marketing Retail, Chemicals, IT Svcs, Hotels, Restaurants &amp; Leisure, Food Products""

""Hey, you jack the price up and those retards will think the squeeze is on, they'll jump on board and jack it up more. You sell when you've hit your mark, double or triple your money real quick and head out. Paper hands will fold and the price will tumble lower and lower down to the $20 or $30 range. Meanwhile, we'll borrow millions of shorts to short the stock at its highest point (which you have already communicated your target price to us) and we'll ride the stock down, down, down, to make a nice profit to cover much of our losses.

Under the ""Fun Facts"" section, it talks about the first meeting consisting of two slides and guess what? ... A TRIP TO MCDONALDS FOR SOFT SERVE. This tweet also surfaced after the CFO was let go. Maybe Cohen is hinting at his active work in restructuring and wants the price to LEAP (LIKE A FROG).

In the paragraph before, it also talks about how Volition's very own Larry Cheng is a very good friend to Cohen and the two stay in contact and have a great relationship both with respect to themselves and investments. What if Larry is coming to be the fire that starts the squeeze? Thoughts?

* Ino is developing Pan-CoV aka multi-valent vaccine concurrently with 3rd dose booster shot trial.

* US P3 trial to start in Q2 upon FDA approval
* Very well tolerated, only grade 1 side effects
* New Cellectra device is super cool, one button operated, gives visual and audio feedback when the procedure is completed, powered by alkaline or rechargeable batteries, USB port to charge the device etc.

JK at NYAS:
1. 5 year shelf live vs 1 year shelf life of other vaccines
2. No need to freeze the vaccine, can handle all temperatures. 
3. 1 &amp; 2 means easier distribution of vaccine
4. Better immune response, T-cell response, makes the vaccine cross protective which means long term protection from Covid. 
5. Better antibody response (meaning you won’t get Covid again)
6. Vaccine is all natural which means no allergic reaction like current vaccines with harmful PEG preservatives 
7. Animals trials have shown you only need 1 dose not multiple doses like current vaccines. This could allude to adding a new single-dose-only 2mg P3 cohort in US and China
8. Has proven to also work on mutant strains. Most recently the newest mutation in Africa and UK. Also INO vaccine is the easiest to adjust for future mutations 
9. Department of defense funding for vaccine

My humble street Cred: When $BB was undervalued (\~7$), I wrote a [DD(click me)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) literally preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump BB meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!

**So Let's start!**

Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!

I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD 🇺🇸 🦅.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&amp;D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**

# FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)

Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.

As The Verge's Sean O’Kane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**

# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?

**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**

Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.

Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.

Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it’s averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won’t be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it’s off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).

Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV’s first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.

**What about international production and sales?**

Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)

**What about Asia?**

Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)

**What about government support in production?**

Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)

**Innovation and Technology:**

Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford’s transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.

**What other EV models are they working on?**

in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.

# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**🦅** after a forest fire.

**TLDR:**

1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **✅** **🇺🇸**

2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **✅**

3- Have the government support. **✅**

4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **✅**

5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **✅**

Right now as I type this, the after hours price of BB is $12.40/share.  That price places quite a few call options in the money.  Take a look at the open interest for calls expiring this Friday (i.e., Feb. 26) at strike prices of $11.00, $11.50, and $12.00.  You are looking at 18,722 contracts open as of the close of trading today (i.e., Feb. 24).

Given the sell-off in the NASDAQ this week, I believe many hedge funds thought BB was going to stay under $11.  (Look at the spike in open interest at $11).  I bet a bunch of the options at $11 and above were written naked.  If BB can close above $13 tomorrow, a **boat load** of call options will be in the money.  Friday could bring a gamma squeeze where BB really takes off. Thanks to today's market action after hours, are we about to see a gamma squeeze in BB?

“Hedge funds bet rally in Canadian silver-mining stocks to run out of steam”

Highlights of the article

TORONTO (Reuters) - Hedge funds have raised their bets against Canadian silver-mining stocks, January short-selling data from a market regulator showed. 

Hedge funds tend to bet a company share price will fall by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back at a lower price when the company dips in value, pocketing the difference.

Short trades as a percentage of total traded volume for First Majestic rose to 28.5% for the second half of January, up from 12.8% in the first half of the month, Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) data showed on Monday. 

Short positions in Pan American rose to 35.9%, from 3.3%, over the same period, while Fortuna Silver Mines saw an increase to 36.6% from 2.2%, and Silvercorp Metals Inc to 23.1%, from 1.4%."|wallstreetbets|SILVER IS RIPE FOR THE PICKING FOR THE STEELY-EYED INVESTOR!|0.0|0.05

The purpose of this post is exploring options and the effect they will have on GME stock. This will not be exploring lack of liquidity, short interest, or fundamentals. 

I went through every call option chain and manually counted volume. So all the numbers I use will be rough estimates and expect a margin of error. 

To sum up the data there is 210k call options expiring this Friday this over half the cumulative volume, that likely will not be relevant unless we see massive price jumps today and early tomorrow.  There is 178k in all the other strikes put together. This is 388k volume in total which is absolutely massive. There is 86k volume concentrated in the 800 strikes. 46K of this is for Friday and the other 40k is all the other expirations.

The two scenarios I will present rest on the fact that the squeeze reaches 850 and delta is roughly 100 making dealers need to hedge 100%. Once it reaches this point shit will start to heat up and price movements will be even more volatile. 

Scenario 1 
Cohen tweets a picture of a rocket ship, price increases 4x in AH and trading tomorrow. This would put price at about 800, dealers become fully hedged and need to have 388 * 1000 * 100 = 38,800,000 million shares by this point. This is more than the entire float. They likely already hold 10mil plus, but in this event they would still need to buy  more 28,800,00 shares. 

Scenario 2
It takes another week for price to rise to the 800 level. All the options from last week expire. This still leaves 178k which means that 17,800,00 still need to be hedged. This event is more likely and has a decent chance of happening has along as we get another catalyst. 

What does this mean for smooth brained retards? Im sure the autist already see where this is going. The simple version is if we reach 800 we will soar right past 1k and trading will become extremely violent. Price targets of 1k are laughable because if we reach 1k we are going right past it.

Here is why- 

1) **We are still up huge from the close of yesterday** and have seen a solid ground at the 140 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.

2) I have read multiple articles claiming **that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.** Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. **So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.** 

3) We know from the past, that without capital **A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.** 

IT won't LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it's the first article.

4) **Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.** Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, **they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.** 

**TL/DR: don't panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday's crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.** This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days.

Everything easy - when market have fears, real apes knows that thing called VOLATILITY comming.

Anyway bubble or not or just correction, fear everywhere. And clever monkey knows, when shit hit the fan - you can take other's stuff, not literally but you know what i mean.

Get something from this shit is easy, ape buying VXX or UVXY and waiting. Today price is close to all times low (15$) which mean when correction will happen - ape will make x2 , x3.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even\_cnbc\_is\_now\_reporting\_that\_melvin\_and\_vlad/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even_cnbc_is_now_reporting_that_melvin_and_vlad/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

They claim to have inside info that the short position loss for Melvin was as high as $16.8B at one point, before they were bailed out by Citadel.  According to earlier reporting, Melvin ended January with $8B in assets.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Melvin was worth $22.6B in their 13F filing on 12/31 back when the share price was $20.  $22.6B-$16.8B= $5.8B. Add the $2.75B bailout that they received from Citadel, and you wind up with $8.5B in assets at the end of January, which roughly checks out with the CNN reporting. So I believe that CNBC's info is genuine.  They go on to speculate about whether or not Gabe Plotkin effectively now works for Citadel due to the terms of the bailout (or what I like to call Citadelvin now that the two are so intertwined). They're not talking about Vlad working for Citadel, (I think  Cramer was confused, what else is new) so put away your torches and pitchforks, for now...

What's interesting is that they say that the loss has since ""come down from there"", and then they received the bailout to ""keep going"".  Remember when Gabe Plotkin called up CNBC in the wee morning hours and claimed to have covered their positions back when price was in the low hundreds before the first squeeze? Up until that point, that was an ATH, so then how did that loss come down if they had exited GME?  The way I see it either 1 of 2 things happened:

&amp;#x200B;

1. They told the truth about closing their shorts or covering with synthetic longs and then re-initiated a net short position later to try and make some back on the decline of the first squeeze.
2. They were lying about covering their original GME positions at all and that $16.8B loss amount was at the peak of the squeeze and was mitigated as the price came back down.

&amp;#x200B;

If first scenario is true, then it means that Citadelvin decided that it was time to take their medicine and get out when the price was in the hundreds, and then a couple days later decided it was a good idea to try to time the peak of the squeeze perfectly at $400 to reinitiate shorts and make some money back.   Maybe that happened and Citadelvin have since exited when GME came back down to the $40 range, maybe the price action we're seeing now is due to Citadelvin finally exiting their net short position, maybe Citadelvin still has a net short position and are in big doo-doo. No matter what, this info that Melvin has recouped some of their losses suggests that the chances are high that Citadelvin maintained a significant net short position into February and may still have a net short position.

(Sorry if I used the wrong flair.)

I started trading last year as a bit of a pandemic hobby, and because my girlfriend had gotten me into it. It was something fun that we could do together and I was excited to learn, since she had about a year's more experience, and a Master's degree in finance. The only hiccup is that she's a lot more risk-averse than I am, so our trading strategies didn't often align.

I've never had much money, and literally lived in a car (or Jeep) for most of my adult life, and will probably go back to doing that once the pandemic is over and being a drifter is more feasible again. (I travel for work, so I was always employed.) I usually described my life like a monk without a religion, just going from place to place wherever I thought I could do the most good. (Though, to be fair, I usually claim my religion as Jedi, because I'm a nerd.) Any money I made, I typically gave it away. I've spent years doing work with causes ranging from children's hospitals to veterans issues to LGBTQ+ and equality concerns. My main interest in life has always been helping people, and my primary financial daydream has always been about funding charities, giving money away to people who need it, and figuring out ways to funnel my wealth into causes worth supporting. 

I've managed to turn $2,000 into roughly $12,000 over the past year, and then fell in with you Apes at the end of January, like so many others did. I YOLO'd into AMC and GME because, like so many of you, I dove in with the mindset of, ""I've been poor forever. I can go back to being even poor-er.""

It's been so genuinely exciting to be around people with whom I share a risk-loving mentality, where I see so many willing to dive right in, knowing full well that we could lose it all, or gain so incredibly much. It was especially heartwarming to see how many of you took those first GME tendies and turned right around to give to children's hospitals, or other important causes. That's when I knew I'd found my people. Right now, I've got everything in GME and AMC, and I might lose it all, but that's no worries. If it goes well, though, then this money could go to do a world of good, and I owe that possibility to each and every one of you.  


**TL;DR: I'm grateful to be here, excited to get to know you, and very hopeful that I can continue to learn lessons (either good or bad) from probably the most hilarious investors I've ever seen in any casino in order to put some good in the world. Cheers to you all, and thank you.**

If you want to know what is causing this GME stock price soar and why  you should be getting in you are in the right place.

 **‘Gamma squeeze’** :

The options buying can, under certain circumstances, create conditions in which a price rally feeds on itself. Known as a “gamma squeeze,” this occurs when the sellers of the call options, in order to hedge their positions, buy the underlying stock. As the price of the stock rises, they need to buy more to maintain their hedge, creating the feedback loop.

Where do we start with this stock. It has basically traded in between $19 and $21 since it IPOed. Last earnings it recorded not only personal records but sectors records yet the price hardly moved at all - in fact dropping a couple of percent. 

Rkt is strong financially, PE ratios of between 5 and 10 expected for the coming years with these slowly being upgraded.

What we’re all interested in here, however, is fast money. So what’s the short interest? The answer - around 40% short interest. Very similar to that of the reddit stocks zooming today.

Now I could talk about mortgage rates staying low, growth potential etc etc but that’s not why I think this stock could boom soon.

Youtube Rocket companies CEO on the stocks Friday surge: in this video the CEO states: “this is not a stock you want to be short in”

(No link to avoid spam filter)

Earnings are today and there is a good chance of some fatal blows to the shorters. Be it the announcement of a dividend, blowout earnings, a new partnership or whatever other news is expected this year from the company. This management doesn’t like shorts and that gives me a feeling that they’re going to be out for blood.

A 40% short interest with 3 days to cover would give an insane rise. I would anticipate 75%+ to mid 30s or even higher. This wouldn’t even place the PE ratio out of bounds of normal industry standards so perhaps we could look at a triple in best case scenarios. This is important as if shorters don’t think the short will come down - especially if they have to pay a dividend - then a short squeeze is more likely. Rkt also has a very small available float. 

Earnings are announced post-market today. The old saying “don’t hold over earnings” is for gay bears and pussies.

Rocket to the moon!

Bullshit. 

Everyone on this board has a strategy. Every one of us has done research. It may not be the sort of research Charlie Munger does, hallowed be his name, but for a lot of us, it was a fucking GREAT strategy based on smart observation. 

In the meantime, Wall Street will tell you it’s a better idea to plow money into managed funds that take a percentage off the top only to historically underperform the market. 

There’s something here. There’s something to collective intelligence and collective investing. The results may be volatile but they speak for themselves.

Jim Cramer is sixty-six, which means he has definitely hit terminal length of his facial hair.  Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim\_Cramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer) and his mustache cannot last much longer.

In that moment, I realized I am bearish on Jim Cramer's facial hair.

**Alright, listen up** **you damn dirty apes**\*\*. I'm going to walk you through why these attempted short squeezes are just a recipe to get your faces ripped off. I'm going to use bold on the important stuff so you'll read it before you see a banana or something shiny.\*\*

This monkey troop is an un-coordinated mess. To channel Henry Kissinger, “Who do I call if I want to speak to [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)?” That's good for legal compliance, but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams.

**1)** **The Prisoners' Dilemma** is a game theory classic. There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they'll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they'll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn't snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.

This is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don't, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don't get caca shoved down their throats. **Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys' hands.**

**2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.** **Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.**

**Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.** **They'll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.** But then they'll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME's peak will really be at **$999**. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at **$998.** But now GME's only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for **$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.** The squeeze never gets squoze.

**3) Why was Volkswagen different?** You've heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don't wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn't going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn't have a recursion problem. **Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn't have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.**

**TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can't squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.**

Recap on VIX: A high VIX means there are significant market irregularities and we should expect volatility and large fluctuations in the S&amp;P500 market. VIX going down means investors are acting normally and we should expect regular S&amp;P500 growth.

The VIX has been on a steady trend downwards since lockdowns began. VIX is played mostly by institutions, not retail investors, as it requires actual market knowledge to not lose money here. Typically, the movement of a smallish cap stock such as Gamestop is not going to have any effect on the VIX. Wall street seems to really be showing their hand here. I think they know that a Gamestop moon rocket could slam the market. Has anyone else been looking at this correlation?

I started with about 5k invested last January, over these 13 months I've put in 12k more amounting to 17k total contribution. The total in my account had gone to about 30k at start of this January,  so In 12 months almost a 13k gain. That's when I got very lucky with GME and ended up selling when my account had reached 90k..very long story about how I could've walked away with 105k but I was a greedy shit. Then that's when it gets bad, I made awful plays after GME hoping for quick climb back to 6 digits.. I bought and sold some very meme plays that made me eat shit. Like I can't believe I didn't walk away at 90k. So right now after making A VERY DUMB move AGAIN with GME..this time I feel like I've gotten burned good enough to walk away? The thought of just buying something right now and hoping it recovers is right there but Im now scared, the worst part about this guilt is that I've gained 20k just this year and went from 17k to 55k from Jan 2020 To Feb 2021. What would you guys suggest? I just truthfully feel a little shitty even though I try to ignore it. Maybe looking for sympathy I don't know. I think stepping away and working my butt off to make money and save it, is the best way to find appreciation for what it is that I gambled away like a madman. However if I didn't play that GME play, I wouldn't have gotten here anyway. FUCK MAN FUCK. IM 25 so some people are saying ""omg young as hell just relax"".... But still this is just so frustrating.

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

At 12:00pm EST The borrowing cost rate on GME has dropped and for AMC remained the same vs. my last report (Tuesday 2/23).

GAMESTOP CORP.-1.995%/APR

AMC -3.43%/APR

While these rates are lower than a few weeks ago, any marked-up rates from    'general  collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to some extent.   There is absolutely NO GME shares to borrow and AMC requires a call to account rep, meaning shares were available earlier in AM but may be fully committed at this point in the day.

At 12:30pm EST My broker got back and did offer AMC shares to borrow for shorting (if I wanted to) at a rate of 3.43%

Why else between a period of two hours yesterday (most of which was after market) would a stock jump like this. These are large buys that they will also sell off at the same time leaving you holding the bags. Hedge funds will count on retail investors to keep buying on the way up, to further bolster the price until an agreed upon number or time. You’ll think it’s just a dip and you’ll buy, when really it’s a nose dive back down to $40. 

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe yesterday was just shorts being covered. Challenge my thought process with proof. To me, it’s more logical that they are manipulating the GME stock and using us as pawns. What would stop them from doing so? The law means nothing to these companies. Fines don’t work. The way things are right now, the market is only free for those who can afford it to be. It’s only without penalty for those who can afford it.

I’m here to expose the blanket corruption and manipulation in the stock market. We need to bring attention to it, and this is the best way we can do so. That’s why I am investing what I can afford to lose. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme.

When I contacted customer services this is the answer I got to why they are not paying out 

I have checked the trading transactions made. The trade were declined by our Broker's side, it seems that they were not able to process the trade transaction and complete it. Usually, transactions are executed by our broker in a few seconds, however, sometimes it may take a little longer, and a delay might apply. If there is a delay the trades are in a pending state. Due to the marked being halted, or the big factor here is the number of orders our partner has received, the nature of the market, the liquidity of the instrument (stock) as well as the volume on the market, it seems that the Broker was not able to authorize the trading transactions and that is why they got declined.

**The Marshmallow Experiment**

Ever seen a kid in front of a Marshmallow in front of a camera fumbling it's fingers trying hard not to eat the Marshmallow? That's basically you and me now. Sure we can reach for the Marshmallow and eat it, sure, a Peugeot can be a comfy car...   


THE KID IS FIVE AND HE DOESN'T EAT IT THO! Why? Because he has enough self control to wait it out. Because he knows that when he contains the urge for 15 minutes he will stand up from the little table, tuck in the little chair in and drive off in a fucking Lambo, THAT'S WHY!!  


Sure, sure, of course, we'd have to wait more than this 15minutes, but guess what! You're not fucking five anymore! You're not living with your mom anymore! Ok, you are, but you also with your wife! Okay, also with her boyfriend, but that's beside the fucking point! Would you rather eat a one measly Marshmallow or wait for when the Experiment is over and have enough Marshmallow to build a fucking house with!  


\- But 103% gaaAAAaaains.  


Okay, I hear you. That may be tempting for you. The part of your brain labeled ""self control"" may be well dead for years now, so here's a little trick. Close the browser, uninstall your trading app. Check back tomorrow if you arrived to the moon yet. Check back in few weeks if need be. You might think that it's enough for you now. You might see that the Marshmallow is getting more red than your ""personal risk tolerance"" allows. Let that just pass. Don't eat the Marshmallow as there are plenty more on the way.  


Disclaimer: None of the above is any kind of advice and shouldn't be considered as such. All fiction, fantasies and bits of stream of consciousness. I eat Marshmallows with soy sauce.

The relationship was going down the shitter anyways so it was for the best. It’s always been that I would celebrate my friends’/gfs’ birthdays but not my own. My friends LOVE to have huge, extravagant parties for their birthdays or go on an expensive trips to some tropical island where everything costs an arm and a leg. 

Not me. What I *LOVE*...is money. Cold, hard CASH!

So instead of partying and splurging, I stayed home that Saturday to learn about stocks and options. This led to accomplishing my dream of becoming an Advisor, taught me more financial responsibility, and ultimately led me to you guys. 

It’s been a real wild ride being here with you all holy fuck. All that studying I did to become an Advisor told me about the red flags of shitty DDs and, most importantly, to *NOT* listen to retards much like yourselves. Even my brother was urging me to sell last week when it was around $40-50. So glad I did the exact fucking opposite!! All that studying: USELESS. My portfolio is balling like Spaulding right now 🏀⛹🏾‍♂️💸

Just wanna thank you guys because this is getting me out of a really shitty rut. I got to knock out a lot of my goals during 2020 but nothing tops buying my first car for my birthday in COLD, HARD CASH!!!

Upwork released earnings on Monday after close. Not only did they beat consensus but they raised their guidance rather significantly. More notably, their CEO said that the trend in usage of the platform does *not* seem to be a feature of the pandemic - rather, usership will only go up as we enter re-opening.

For those that don't know, Upwork is kind of like Uber for the gig economy. Economists have been saying this is the future of the job market for years. Say what you will about valuation being stretched (that hasn't seemed to matter the last decade or so), they could be poised to grow massively over the next decade. There is a positive feedback loop as more people adopt the platform. The same way that using Uber, for example, makes you more dependent on using Uber, so does using Upwork. Millennials and Gen Zers have shown a clear desire for career flexibility, which only adds to the bull thesis.

For the sake of this post not just being propaganda, the bear thesis is that it may be overvalued, and that a bigger social media enterprise could build a similar type of platform. To the first, I say maybe, but look at Tesla. To the second, I say, if adoption of the platform is/continues to become significant enough, anyone trying to replicate it will be too late to the party. For example, Facebook has a marketplace now, and have for years, yet eBay is still alive and well, and actually thriving.

This is not financial advice.

However, higher IV options means a higher current price whereas a lower IV options appreciates based on both increase in stock price and increase in IV.  Take a look at the current IV of the above three stocks, see the links below.

https://imgur.com/a/g3Ou8E1

Essentially GME IV at 700, AMC at around 300 and BB Options at 100.  For you tards that have no idea what this means…essentially you are too fucking poor to buy GME options.
Now let’s simulate a 50% increase and what that means on the option that is closest OTM.
GME - Stock 168 to 252 Option Feb26 170c  goes from 23.58 to 81.41 (3x assuming IV stays the same)
AMC - Stock 11.1 to 16.65 Option Feb26 12c  goes from .36 to 4.72 (13X assuming IV+100)
BB – Stock 12.4 to 18.6 Option Feb26 12.5c  goes from .213 to 6.10 (28X assuming IV+200)
So my fellow apes and retards, you need about 35K to get to an M on B if it appreciates by 50% in a day
Now of course, the chances of GME going up 50% in a day is much greater than AMC or BB but for BB you literally only need BB to increase to 13.1 or only a 5.6% increase to 3X.
BTW in the last squeeze…BB went from essentially 12 to 26 in 5 days during the GME squeeze…if BB literally only go to 20 in 5 days on the march 5 12.5 c…it goes from .7 to fucking 7.5 or 10.7X"|wallstreetbets|YOLO 28X BB FD Options vs 13X AMC FD Options vs 3X GME FD Options for 50% rise in a day|60.0|0.9

Good morning you beautiful smooth brains! 

As I’m sure you’ve seen this morning, GME has been all over the place with leaps up and down. And many of you don’t understand what a **Trade Halt** is, so I figured I’d fix that.

Many of you seem to be getting **Trade Halt** and **Trade Restrictions** confused. 

A *Trade halt* is put in place by the market makers (the SEC, NYSE, etc.) and are often automatically triggered when a security leaps up **OR** down a set % (usually 10%) in the span of 5 minutes. These halts can last anywhere from 10 minutes, to an entire day if the SEC needs to conduct an investigation. 

Some brokers make it clear what’s happening, others don’t. But don’t panic when you see your favorite stock stop trading for a few minutes, this is perfectly normal. 

As I’m sure you all know, *Trade Restrictions* are put in place by the brokerages for a variety of reasons. These restrictions limit the purchase of certain securities, but never the ability to sell. Trade Restrictions are incredibly suspicious and are often done for shitty reason, but they’re something to watch out for nonetheless. 

The other thing that’s clear you new blood aren’t familiar with, is **Margin** trading. Think of Margin like you would a credit card (because that’s basically what it is). You’re buying stocks with your brokers money, with the intent of repaying it when you profit, and you keep the difference. **HOWEVER**, Margin also means your broker has a right to limit their exposure to risk, which means they can close out on your margin positions without notice, they can limit the securities you can use margin with, and they can simply terminate your use of margin if you’re deemed too high risk.

*Margin* is how people get hurt. You have to be careful if you use it, though I’d recommend staying away as much as you can, and stick with cash accounts. There have been cases of people getting MASSIVE margin limit approvals, and then when they lose, they’re on the hook for a quarter of a million.

So be careful your there, and always be sure to do your own research on a stock.

Also remember: 

*“Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.”*

Don’t get greedy


TL,DR: learn the important terms, and GET greedy. You can’t lose if you don’t sell (you can’t win either).

They do it at the end of the day so by the time everybody hears about it, it's too late to buy options. Those that do buy calls on the huge upward momentum raise the IV and raise the shit out of the contract prices. 

Who's selling the covered calls? The same hedges that got burned to shit. And they're selling them all the way up to $500 collecting commission for days. They do it the day before expiration to reduce risk on retail taking over the price again. It's an artificial inflation of the price created by the same people that got bailed out last time around. 

They could do this every week while GME is a hot topic and make a killing. Push price power hour wednesday, cash out on commissions of a price they're controlling thursday, sell-off to keep price around whatever HOPE is valued at.

I am being driven **insane** by my employer's asinine trade approval policies and I know I am not alone here. Throughout the whole GME saga I was (and still am) unable to get in on the action due to the fact that every trade I make has to be meticulously approved by compliance and then held for a predetermined amount of time. If I do not adhere to these rules then I could literally lose my job. To be honest, I wasn't all that confident that the short squeeze strategy would ever work, but I was **fully willing** to throw in a few thousand into GME in hopes that I would be sent to the moon. I know that I'm not alone here either, as many of my coworkers and peers expressed that they'd be in GME (and similar trades) if they were given full autonomy over their PAs. Somebody please tell me why a PM at a top fund can go on the news and start pumping up their positions but half of the financial services industry cannot get involved in the securities that are being pumped up. It is ridiculous. 

Obviously these policies are extremely necessary in some cases (e.g. an RX analyst is aware of an impending bankruptcy or an M&amp;A MD just landed a role on a blockbuster merger) but there has to be a better way for compliance to handle all of this. For example, why does somebody working in retail wealth management need to submit a formal trade approval request for five Apple shares, and then hold the shares for a set amount of time, when they and compliance both know that this advisor in middle-of-nowhere Ohio will likely **never** be in a position to have non-public information pertaining to Apple? 

In my current role I work with high-profile hedge funds (like Melvin) nearly every single day and ***almost never*** do I come across any information that would benefit my PA. And guess what...compliance would have absolutely **no idea** if I ever did. Zero idea. None. They would just slowly approve my trade and move along to the next request. The systems in place are largely for show and really only apply to a select few people. Everyone knows this. 

Insider trading ideas are generated on the golf course and at country clubs, not places where compliance/regulators can see you, and making life difficult for fresh MBA associates at a bank isn't going to secure the integrity of financial markets... Maybe regulators and compliance should actually be more targeted in their efforts to secure the integrity of markets. Maybe they could start by going after the institutional players that actually have the capacity to materially move prices???

Imagine how much more retail capital might flow toward some of these trades if financial services professionals (who are often highly-paid and passionate about markets) were allowed and/or felt free to get involved. 

Compliance, if you are reading this, *please get a new system that actually makes sense and stop breathing down my neck. If I want to throw money away into a trade that might blow up in my face then let me do so.*

Regulators, if you are reading this, *please come up with regulations that actually monitor what matters and stop restricting the little guy for braindead reasons. The façade is starting to fade and people are starting to notice that you aren't working in their best interests.*

💎🚀🌕


History repeats itself... The story of Nokia is that of a modern day epic. Here's why:

""Nokia Bell Labs is an American industrial research and scientific development company owned by Finnish company Nokia. With headquarters located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.""

\- 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.

\- The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed here.

With the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100 year old think-tank to be leveraged once more.

### TLDR: Nokia is going to be one of the 3 kings in the world of 5G/6G... which will be used in EVERYTHING that matters in the next decade and this is the absolute ground floor.

All data that I present is publicly available. By no means do I claim to be an expert, nor is this financial advice. This is simply observation and speculation. I simply like the stock.

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## (Hard) SPECULATION:

\- ""Big tech trades human futures"" - Zuboff, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism

\- IMO, modern institutions are very cunning... Everything they do has purpose.

\- From the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade ""whale"" for ""institution"".

\- Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole GME/Robinhood farce has further smeared their image to traditional retail investors. Many investors are repulsed from this company.

\- We have seen the clients of Big Tech influencing geopolitics to an astounding degree in the past few years through social media and surveillance capitalism... I believe that financial institutions have now caught on and now are cashing out on social media to move the markets...

\- Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the ""Robinhood"" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock, JPM, etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.

\- Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. ""Robinhooders"" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, they can release DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report? It smells fishy!

2 Possible threads of speculation:

\- Accumulation

\- Inst. ownership as of Q4 2020 is only 5.30%, shares float is 5 Bn... child's play to manipulate with high float. Other high growth companies that institutes are betting on have 90%+ inst. ownership.

\- Impulse Wave 1 was a test breakout... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created with public participation.

## FA:

""Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?

Welcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow – no matter what directions it is taking.

There is nothing else like WING on the market."" - Nokia website

\- Like Blackberry, a comparison can be made to the mining sector. At the start of new bubbles, CapEx for juniors get filled very quickly. If we make a comparison to precious metals miners... this company is a first wave major, not a second wave junior.

\- Nokia, Elisa and Qualcomm together have achieved the fastest 5G speeds recorded in the world.

5G Market:

Market size value in 2020: USD 41.48 Billion Revenue forecast in 2027: USD 664 Billion

""The global 5G Applications and Services Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 25.8% from 2019 to 2027"" (According to 180+ page research report by Fidelity National Financial)

25.8% CAGR sounds good to me...

Verticals:

\- Manufacturing

\- Energy &amp; Utility

\- Media &amp; Entertainment

\- IT &amp; Telecom- Transportation &amp; Logistics

\- Healthcare

\- Retail

\- Agriculture

\- O&amp;G and Mining

\- BFSI

\- Construction

\- Real Estate

Sounds like a service that has unlimited applications... My favorite type of technology!

\- The global market for Internet of things (IoT) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.

\- 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT.

\- ""5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.""

\- What is the number 1 problem that EV wishes to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock.

\- 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!

\- 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!

Key contracts and partnerships:

\- The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX.

“Why would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?”

Thierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth.

In October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE/4G communications system on the Moon.

\- 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!

\- Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&amp;T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G. As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&amp;T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.""

\- Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project

\- Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... ""Being a 2.5-year project within EU’s Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. Nokia has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology."" - Ericsson's website.

\- ""Google Cloud and Finland’s Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release.

The companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia’s 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud’s AI, ML and analytics technologies. The solutions will run on Google’s Anthos platform.""

Yes.. a Google partnership.

Take the below figures with a grain of salt... Sources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea:

5G Hardware Market Share 2020:

\#1. Huawei - 28%

\#2. Nokia - 16%

\#3. Ericsson - 14%

(These figures vary depending on the source, but it is clear that these 3 are the leaders by far)

Investors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents. Those who own the patents are the power brokers in the industry.

Total 5G patents owned 2019:

\#1. Huawei - 13,474

\#2. Qualcomm - 12,719

\#3. Samsung - 9,299

\#4. Ericsson- 8,116

\#5. LG - 7,694

\#6. Nokia- 5,554

There is an argument for Standard-Essential Patents (SEP) ownership... supposedly, which patents actually matter, and Nokia owns about 3,000. I am no expert on IP law or 5G technology, but these figures gives me a rough estimate, and are an indicator to the larger picture. Robert L. Stoll from Faegre Drinker's report has some good secondary sources if you want to dig into this.

A quick calculation of Value metrics:

\- Current Mcap of 23.35 Bn.

\- 16% market share of projected 664 Bn... Market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.

\- 664 Bn x 0.16 = 106 Bn Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 106 Bn/5 Bn shares = 21 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $21.00 USD by 2027.

\- Current price = $4, 21/4 = 5, so a 400% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.

\- Tesla's current P/S ratio is 23.78, and Zoom had a high of 108.95 with the lowest being 25.83.

Does it sound right to you?

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## TA:

\- MACD has crossed over on lower time frames to bullish, and is converging on the 1D.

\- Current Price action shows fake consolidation... Motive Sequence has already begun.

\- The first run up to 10 must be wave 1 of the motive sequence, as this corrective wave has gone below the previous high.

\- Fib levels for wave 3 and 5 are around 14 and 21.

## QA:

First, the problem with options...

\- 142,040 Open Interest for options expiring 2/26/2021

\- 158,201 Open Interest for options expiring 3/05/2021

\- 434,917 Open Interest for options expiring 3/19/2021

It is possible that these need to expire before we move up again. However, all is not lost:

\- Heavy speculative call interest, with large short interest (in this case short volume) that are pushing up against major resistance levels can quickly pop higher. This indicates that they have consolidated and are getting ready for the next large move.

\- NOK had 370.0 ATM IV on Jan. 27, 2021, where the MM was forced to gamma hedge and we got the big but short-lived pop. Currently 50.2. This can be interpreted two ways. Low IV is good if organic growth and MM pinning pressure to ease, but abnormally low IV compared to the historic IV, where there is large negative gamma exposure means a big directional move is imminent.

\- Once again, call skew is turning bullish. Option interest always leads the price!

Institutional Behavior:

\- 442 institutional investors, and rising... More than Palantir Technologies...

\- Average 13F ranking rising (calculated from Total # of 13F shares and # of Funds holding)

\- institutional interest is GREATLY decoupled from stock price! Extremely bullish indicator. Price is what you pay, Value is what you get.

Q4 2020 All 13F Filers Prior Change Hedge Funds 1 Prior Change

In top 10: 2 4 -50.0% 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.06%) -100.0%

Total Puts 15.368 Million 15.437 Million -0.45% 3.146 Million 3.439 Million -8.5%

PUT/CALL Ratio 0.94 0.82 14.63% 0.77 0.46 67.39%

I always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money. Words are cheap. Follow the money.

\- \*\*Blackrock increased their position 333,000,000 shares during 2020, an increase of 21 million shares held from the year before (7% increase) and representing a 5.90% ownership of the company.\*\*

\- State Street increased their position by 2,039,035 in Q4 2020, bringing their total to 2,372,220.

\- Susquehanna increased their position by 5,030,133 shares as the 6th largest holder in Q4 2020, with 10,849,501 total and significantly decreased their options positions, both puts and calls.

\- Renaissance Technologies increased their position by 4,149,027, with 7,688,612 total as the 10th largest holder in Q4 2020.

\- \*\*Citigroup increased their CALL position by 85,900, decreased their Put position by 52,600, and sold 1,347,617 shares.\*\*

\- \*\*Citadel increased their call position by 1,266,800 to a total of 1,680,100 and decreased their Put position by 283,700... They still have 2,567,900 Puts as of Q4 2020.\*\*

\- Nokia has a Short Volume Ratio generally ranging between 10-15... GME currently has 15-25 to give you an idea, and this puts it in the range of the top 10 companies with the highest short volume on the market.

\- NOK has a 5.3 Bn shares float, making the stock unbelievably easy to manipulate via short selling. The short interest is useless here, short volume is what to look at.

 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## Speculation:

\- I have noticed that BlackRock and JPM have been massively accumulating shares in companies that I believe have the deepest of value, and are future tech monopolies (PLTR).

\- Such movement has been preceded by RenTech, Citigroup, and Citadel, RenTech and Citadel being top Quantitative Hedge Funds.

\- Speculative interest appears in the Robinhood community.

\- Extreme media FUD campaigns and short-selling follows to depress the price, while BlackRock and JPM accumulate enormous amounts of shares.

\- The Quants are playing MM for BlackRock and JPM. They are RUTHLESS! I have suffered for 2 months at their hands at Palantir!

\- The news will be out soon... This won't stay down here much longer. Information moves quick nowadays. Maybe Cathie will buy in.

To be an investor in such conditions, one must have the strongest of conviction. One must do their own DD... Conviction cannot be outsourced.

So first of all, we have to address the elephant in the room, or should I say the motherfucking FROG???

NANI??! Why a frog, you say? Well… what does a frog do? They jump up and down. What else jumps up and down? Yes… you motherfucking guessed it you dipshit

**STONKS**.

The fucking Mcdonalds logo confirms it. Just look at how the M is drawn... Let me give you a clue, motherfucker. IT GOES UP AND DOWN.

And what sound does a frog make? YES. It’s **RIBBIT**. Now… what other word is a 6 letter word, and starts with R and ends with T??? YES. SAY IT LOUDER YOU MOTHERFUCKER.

**REDDIT**.

Our boi is sending us a message. He’s telling us to **HOLD** until we see **GREEN**. Green, you say?? Why in the heavens, so? Open your eyes, you colourblind motherfucker. What colour is the frog???

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ICE CREAM I HEAR YOU SAY?

Think about it. There’s only a certain time frame until the ice cream melts and becomes pointless. The ice cream represents us cashing out on GAMESTOP. What happens if we eat the ice cream? We get FAT, motherfuckers. FROM. THE. GAINZZ.

BUT eating the ice cream isn’t without its problems. What happens if we cash out all our money too early??? What happens if we eat the ice cream too fast??? That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, and retards.

We get BRAIN FREEZE.

Cohen is warning us the shares for Gamestop will freeze, damn hedge funds will do anything to prevent this from rising, but Cohen is showing support by telling us to be patient. Motherfucker named his company Chewy cos he’s telling us to chew. **DON’T FUCKING SWALLOW IN ONE GO**. Savour every moment, motherfucker.

1614258791.0|0.0|t3_ls6alg|53.0|"Today I'd like to talk to you guys about a little company I refer to as ""The T"".

The T or AT&amp;T might not seem that interesting at first glance. It looks pretty boomer to be honest, and it's hardly moved in the past 10 years. My argument to you is that this is going to change and do so quickly.

My rationale for a long position in The T is simple, I think we are looking at the next Disney. I think one of the biggest future streaming platforms is likely to be HBO Max. HBO Max is currently owned by you guessed it The T.

Before I get into the numbers I want to take a moment and give you some of the Intellectual Property currently owned by The T.

· All of HBO (Game of Thrones, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Westworld, Sopranos, The Wire, and more)

· All of Turner Broadcasting IP (This includes TNT, TBS, CN/\[adult swim\], and TruTV)

· All of DC (Batman, Superman, Watchmen, Aquaman and more)

· Currently planned for development on the HBO max platform is a new season of Game of Thrones, The Boondocks, New DC content including Static Shock, a Venture Bro's special, as well as transitioning Rick and Morty to HBO Max exclusive.

Now for the math behind my decision.

Looking at the fundamentals of The T should surprise you. With a market cap of 204.44b it's valued 25% lower than competitor Netflix while maintaining a P/E of 9. By comparison Netflix's P/E is over 80 implying The T should be almost NINE TIMES what it is now if we were valuing it the same as Netflix.

Dis which comes in at a whopping 93 P/E ratio while offering similar services to The T. While Disney might have more IP at the moment if The T continues to merge with company's it can easily compete. One potential target may be Viacom who own many shows that are popular.

If the T were to sit at a P/E Ratio of even just 20 it would be 63.5$ per share a jump of over 100%. The big catalyst will be an increase in HBO Max subscriptions and an expansion of 5G networks.

I personally believe the upside of The T may be around 75% or more over the next 12 months. A huge event being overlooked is the release of the Boondocks new series. One of the most popular series in \[adult swim\] history we can expect this to be a catalyst for growth in HBO Max activations.

Right now The T is on discount I believe and intend on trying to take full advantage of the situation picking up as many shares as I can.

I could talk more maybe about 5G or other lanes of The T's business, but I'll save that for later. For the moment I am focused on one thing and that is streaming as a possible area of significant growth in this company. Perhaps even a trigger of momentum status over the next 24 months."|wallstreetbets|DD For Men With Low T|53.0|0.81

There has been a lot of confusion about the amount of shares outstanding AMC has. The company issued a lot (c.350m shares recently) from its roughly 100m pre COVID count. When measuring total shares out on loan or short (which is roughly 48m) it is important to understand how big the free float actually is.

According to this SEC filing filed by AMC: (you can find all filings if you search AMC SEC):

[https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/512648ea-ce75-4aef-8855-55b8d3fd9709.html)

The share count after the ATM program completed was: 365m (all float)

(Search the linked document for 356,498,711)

This was before Sikverlake converted their convertible into an additional 44m of shares.

See filing here:

[http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/eb4eda51-9031-49ee-ae23-abcef50a8152.html](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/eb4eda51-9031-49ee-ae23-abcef50a8152.html)

After that Wanda converted roughly 50m B shares into A shares to sell them off

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html)

**To summarize:**

**there is about 450m shares (365+44+50)=450 shares outstanding – and that is all float.**

**So its short interest about 10% of float.... market watch has the wrong shares outstanding and the 80% is purely wrong as they have a float of around 57m (which used to be the old A shares before they started issuing more stock)**

This are the official SEC filings – also AMC has a share authorisation for a further 500m shares… when the stock goes up they just turn up the dilution tap.

**Given the trading volume it takes a whopping 0.2-0.3 days to cover the short.. hardly critical and hardly heavy shorted. and 100m of options do not make the difference... that is another 0.2d**

**Fundamentally it’s a terrible company (not that fundamentals matter too much)**

\- AMC has never produced any FCF. It had 5bn of debt before COVID at relatively low interest payments.

\- Due to COVID they had to raise an additional 1200m of debt at high cost. The last 100m loan from Mudrich Capital charged 17!!! %

\- To stay alive they had to print stock at a rapid speed. Share count is not 4.5x pre COVID. It was trading below USD 10 pre covid.

\- Why would it trade above an implied USD 50 (at current share prices) Despite 1bn + extra debt?

**So this short term momentum squeeze might be very very short lived. Enjoy it while it lasts..**

&amp;#x200B;

Today the theme is the same, real rates are now reaching a territory where the pension funds and macro HFs will have to sell high duration names (that's QQQ for you retards)

&amp;#x200B;

**a) Why do we care ?**

Real rates over 10 years reflect the expectation of the average interest rate minus inflation over next 10 years. This is the biggest driver of valuations of stocks who have no cash flows or whose cashflow are only expected to come in much later. In the physical sense they also reflect the true level of return people are willing to lend to the US.

In financial theory, P = f(some other bullshit)/(1+real rates) (to simplify)

real rates go up, your valuation needs to go down because the required rate of return is now more stringent in an economy that is expected to do well.

The above was purely conceptual, let's study this statistically and see if it is true

If you do a multi regime Linear regression of valuation of NQ vs several drivers this is what you end up with

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h53lmyp9dmj61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b276d6367968b1f36ac0b00c14fd91e430313b9b

What i want you to look at is PSG (price sales growth valuation ratio) vs R\_yield). no matter the regime it doesn't look good for valuations if real yields are going up. that has been true forever in NQ.

it's true on a statistical (meaning reality) but also in conceptual terms. **undisputable, I'm I clear enough?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6211xv06amj61.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22a1aea0c97ce2c22125e273fd92a212800912f

**b) Why are real rates going up ?**

Well mostly, the FED has realized that having a steeper curve benefits the real economy (think west coast vs all the rest of the .. world) as it incentivizes banks to lend more.

Thus they are allowing it by not implementing YCC. Yesterday all FED VIPs spoke publicly and that was why NQ was going up since the powell speech 2 days ago but NONE OF them delivered the goods. thus the ""truce"" is over for NQ and for real rates

On the supply side bond buyers are fed up with such low yields when the US is about to unleash enough stimulus to reach a 7% followed by a 4% GDP year on fucking year. they are tired of getting fucked and are protesting. A lot of bond auctions have been going really sour latley such as yesterday's 61Bn auction which had a 6bps tail and left 1/4th of the 61bn in the hands of the dealers...

**c) What's a fair number on the real rates thingy then ?**

i think in the near term -0.5% we are at -0.748 at moment of speaking. this would statistically suggest a 8% drawdown in NQ from here.

**TLDR : Get QQQ puts or at least sell your NQ holdings and similar you fucking gambling cunts.**

Given that they're going to need to get that money from somewhere (and who would try to bail them out at this point), they may well try to sell off some of their other holdings to raise capital.  They have over 5% ownership in Hyatt Hotels ($H), Expedia ($EXPE), L Brands ($LB), American Eagle Outfitters ($AEO), and Texas Roadhouse ($TXRH).  As such, one could expect to see a decent dip in their prices if they have to sell off.  In fact, all of these stocks had a noticeable drop during the first squeeze (deepest on Jan 27), that almost exactly inverses $GME.  In particular, $H, $EXPE, and $LB dropped 10%-20% at lowest.  There is also the potential upside later this year for post-Covid spending for $H, $EXPE, and $TXRH as well.  For anyone who may be sitting out this 🚀 ride, or are looking for a place to put tendies afterward, these stocks may be worth a look.

GME doesn't look like it's seeing nearly the increase in short volume that AMC has seen over the last few days.

Big F to all the palantards, took quite a while to reply to everyone

About GME I still don't know what to do today. A part of me says ""fucking sell and cash out"", the other part is thinking: what if this gets to "" the thousands"", like the CEO of Interactive Brokers said it could have happened on the first squeeze if they didn't restrict buying the stock?

I'm in a Robin Hood group on Facebook and the sentiment is all for AMC, almost noone supports GME, most of them hate it. And I think this is good cause it makes me think that most of GME hodlers already left Robin Hood. So this time their tricks might not work again!

Thinking rationally: I'm up few months of my salary so far and it wouldn't change much to me, so I guess I'll just hold and buy the dip (I hope there will be one at the opening)! You think about your financial situation and behave accordingly, don't listen to anyone

Finally, about PLTR, I closed the position. I liked a DD I red here yesterday and I'll be buying it back in 1-2 weeks at 25

One of the global leaders in 5G. The previous CEO which brought NOK down was fired and replaced by Pekka Lundmark late last year. Under him he guided the company back to profitability in 1 quarter with increasing positive free cash flow. He also fired a number of those useless employees and trimmed the fats. Pekka radically reorganized Nokia into independent business units each responsible for P/L. Profitability and revenue surely going up.

Massively undervalued. Has nett cash (means after deducting debt) on hand. Small market cap compared to next competitor Ericsson.

More contracts in 5G than Ericsson (go google number of 5G contracts between both companies). During the ex-ceo term, yes they lost some market share but Pekka has sworn to win back market share and be leaders in 5G. They are clinching many 5G deals this year.

Black rock increased their positions in nOK recently. 

5G is expected to reach trillions in worth in years to come. Massive growth year on year.

Nokia is also the european leader in building 6G (code named project Hexa)

Nokia is building telecom technology on the moon under Nasa contract with Intuitive Machines.

With Huawei gone even more market share. 

Under HMD global (also from Espoo Finland run by Nokia phone ex-executives) which pays royalty to nokia, nokia is now releasing phones under android in India.. the world's largest phone market now outside China. So Nokia is not just 5G but is trying to recapture the consumer mobile market too. With many chinese mobile having limitations in india, Nokia has a chance to ride up here.

Pekka Lundmark will turn this company into a massive multibagger.

Keep snatching new 5G contracts. 2/3 giant telecoms (M1/Starhub) in Singapore are with Nokia. Philippines largest telecom (Globe) just announced yesterday they are going with Nokia. Just to share Philippines was considering Huawei but the recent pandemic and political tension has led Nokia to pick up market share. I believe more to come.

I heard some people worry Starlink will displace 5G. That's totally untrue. In fact, Starlink will complement NOKIA's 5G equipment. Starlink beams down bandwidth from the high heavens and Nokia beams it around the city/indoor/tunnel. Yes nokia and Starlink are complementary as they serve different parts of the entire chain.

Nokia was just named as 2021's one of the top most ethical companies. Smell the ESG / ethical / responsible investing drift yet?

But why trust me? Do read the news and make up your own mind. I'm not a financial advisor, just sharing my personal opinion on my favorite stock in my portfolio. For far too long Nokia has been neglected. Whether in pandemic or out of Covid, NOKIA is a solid profitable company with a huge potential. Yes they had a decade of bad results, but everything has changed under our lord and savior, the sandbagging Pekka Lundmark (as a typical Finn, he likes to undersell and overdeliver. He is a depressing person to talk to, but he is a hard worker and will bring Nokia to great heights).

I love NOKIA.

Comment or message me if you have any more people or even vows from yourself and I will add to the list. Once each price mark is passed I will put a diamond on the people who promised to do stuff at that mark. Mods and tattoo artists, take note!

BE WARNED. EVEN IF YOU ARE JOKING IN THE COMMENTS, I WILL STILL PUT YOU DOWN

EDIT: I need to take 30 minutes for my mental health. This is incredibly stressful, but don’t worry! If it takes me 10 years I will still add you all. No autist left behind!

**Unity is a game engine, which is the most important infrastructure of game making** \- before game engines appeared, game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves, then a lot of wrappers appeared (OpenGL, etc) and after that the game engines. The **game engine allows the developer to connect the code, graphics, music, physics, and basically everything together.**

Most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines. But as far as I concern, the only public, known, large and practically adopted by developers are Unity and Unreal Engine (we'll back to that shortly).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get back to Unity:

As a game developer (also ML/DL, but who cares), I've used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years, hell, I even used ""dark basic"" when I was young, and I can say that **Unity is the only time I felt at home**.

Now **I know you don't give a shit about my experience, so let's talk business**.

**The GOOD stuff:**

Unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and that's a FULLY CROSS PLATFORM ENGINE, that means that I can develop once, and **my stupid stuff would work PC, Android, iOS, Xbox, Playstation, Virtual Reality, Web..**. You got the idea...  
That work of being cross platform is INSANELY HARD, which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product. Even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support, which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support.

TL;DR 1:  **Cross Platform**

Unity got a huge asset store, which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me, that means that even if I'm totally not profitable - Unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team.  
The huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform, and like Maya vs 3DSmax or Nikon vs Canon - the first one you've touched is gonna be the only one you'll know.

TL;DR 2: **Easy step in, huge asset store, revenues even from non-profitable games**

  
Next, the future. Game industry is growing and we all know it, but what Unity got that it would outperform the market? Glad you've asked, they got everything.  
Unity supports Machine Learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application - well that's too general right? So let me put it like that:  
3 years to the future, self driving cars are more and more popular and... regulated. When you regulate it you also have to test it - digitally. Unity is one of 2 (!) game engines that practically gonna be available for that task.  
Virtual Reality is also a trend - guess how most developers develop for it. Also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that.

TL;DR 3: **Tons of ""room to grow"" - VR, Algorithms and algorithms testing**

  
As I've mentioned, Unity got only one real competitor - Epic - which got  Unreal Engine that does basically the same. Epic are not public but hopefully will, but currently Unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product. If I had to choose, I would just put my Happy Hippos on both.

TL;DR 4: **No publicly traded competitors**  


Lastly, Unity can grow without a single phone call. There is no major difference for Unity to support 1K users or 1M (just like Google or Facebook) - if we compare it to companies like TTOW, Nintendo and even Xbox-Microsoft and Oculus (Facebook) - they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making.

TL;DR 5: **Unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user**

&amp;#x200B;

**Now for the BAD stuff:**

Unity price was very high, how much high? At the pick Unity passed EA (!) in terms of market cap. That's high.

It's currently at 35% discount right now, and it still might considered high - but do notice it's around 50%-60% more than IPO day (PLTR fore example is already multiplied - I think they were out on the same day).

TL;DR 6: **High Price (whatever that means...)**

Another bad thing - Unity had relatively bad quarter - their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative... Why is that? Well... first of all they've something like 750,000 shares, which is like 80M$ - that's exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter - you know what that means for the next one...

TL;DR 7: **Last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings - mostly due to stupid reasons**

As I've mentioned, large companies generally use their own game engines, that's a lot of money the currently Unity miss.

Lastly, Epic might go public sooner or later, it won't be a surprise if $U would go down some percents at the same day. But for the long run, ETFs would buy both of the stocks (like ARK/ARKK did with Unity) and that would bring the price up.

TL;DR 8: **Their only real competitor might go public sooner or later**

**That's it, if you survived everything tell me what you think.**

For me I think I'll just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know what's gonna be.

Disclaimers: **I know nothing about nothing. I'm not an investment advisor and don't take any advice from me - or in general don't just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that, read about it yourself.**

**I'm just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and its cross platform abilities for my game.**"|wallstreetbets|Unity - for the Crazy or for the Tanks? - Game Developer POV [$U]|40.0|0.88

* **GameStop** Volatility is picking up
* **“Meme Stock”** phenomenon is not going away
* **Success in GME** could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system
* **Instant clearing** will not occur quickly
* **Regulators** will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault

After a few weeks of “normal” 20%-30% intraday moves GameStop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterday’s regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168.

#### Volatility is picking up

The volume in after hours alone  surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41M shares changing hands. It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.

The fact that GME’s volume could approach the volume of AAPL – a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent “meme stock” which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.

#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes

The GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow. 

While this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We’ve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.

#### Regulators Will Need to Step In

We have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven’t changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if “meme trading” is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions – a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday’s FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions – a much larger and more important business – is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a “brownout” event – much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.

The events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.

#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play

At this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current  versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the “meme stock” security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes. The bans would have to be backed by strict civil penalties for any OTC trading of such securities so that the threat of punitive damages would cool off speculative flows. 

If a hobbyist Robin Hood trader who held $2000 of a suspended meme stock suddenly faced the prospect of a $50,000 fine for illegally trading it, the speculative fervor would cool.

#### Anathema to Free Markets

This is of course a complete anathema to the notion of friction free securities markets where any participant is at liberty to do use his capital as he pleases. It is undoubtedly a drastic solution to the problem at hand, but for now it may be the only policy choice to make given the unintended consequences of letting this phenomena play itself out without any supervision.

The current financial system is simply unprepared and incapable of absorbing highly coordinated speculative flows that could overrun the underlying business of the global capital markets. The ultimate irony of the GameStop saga is that the very technology that has created unimaginable freedom to transact instantly at minimal cost may invite the most restrictive response imaginable in order to avoid a massive destabilization of the markets.

&gt;I have been following WSB for 1-2 months, just before all the hype began. I, of course, also joined into GME train and made some gains in the early days but then got in again too high and didn't expect hedgies to play this dirty so I am still holding, guess I have diamond hands.

If there’s such a thing as a guaranteed loss, it’s buying bonds during inflation. Inflation devalues cash, so savings accounts won’t be the answer. That leaves stocks. Historically, inflation lifts the stock market, but we’ve never had inflation during the tech era, where many companies are financing their growth until they can get to scale. Would that financing be crimped? I don’t think so, and that’s why I think everyone saying that growth stocks will get hurt by inflation is wrong. The way companies raise money will shift. We’ll see a lot more convertibles notes, shadow shares, and all manner of creative structures, but they’ll get their financing and it won’t be at inflated rates. 

If this were 20 years ago, perhaps the naysayers would have been right. However, it’s been too long that tech has provided the returns. The market is too used to the promise of tech stocks being the future, which is why creative lending, SPACs/IPOs for retail, and PE firms will ride to the rescue.

# Quick Thoughts

**Inflation is not as much of a concern as people think**

Look, I've talked about inflation risks for three weeks now and this is old news at this point. Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.

But first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.

But it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we're talking about. So read this 10 times :

*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*

Read it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I'm sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.

This is because the average consumer didn't receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. ""*But have you seen Amazon's revenue?*"" you might say. ""*Yes, I've seen it*"" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! 

But I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn't travel, didn't party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they'd buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they're stuck at home).

So, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it's setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that's another story).

And with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.

So yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let's talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.

The concern is as follow :

&gt; FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don't look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that's ready to burst.

Ok, so a few things about that :

- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it's been a bubble ""ready to burst"" for a decade or so.
- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.
- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That's why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that's why Tesla's stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. 
- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there's not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. 

There might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they're not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.

And I'll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :

&gt; Fuck your puts.

Also, there's [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).

Ok now let's talk about Powell speech for a minute.

**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**

Summary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!

Seriously, that's it!

He said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. 

He said that the inflation concerns are overblown.

Then senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said ""wtf I'm just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president."" (I'm paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn't give any solution because well as he said it very well, he's ""not the fucking president"" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).

The Senator Kennedy asked ""*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*"" (yes he actually said that, I'm NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn't know the reference (and frankly I don't fully understand what that meant either).

[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)

He also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today's recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you'll get my ""quick"" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it's not quick).

**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**

This is a short one because I've talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.

But now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it's a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). 

But there's something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.

[Here's a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). 

But something might change that. I really don't want to talk politics here so let's make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There's more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.

So, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.

Anyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).

**Here's a list of luxury brand companies**

2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here's a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :

- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it's a better bet than the others imo)
- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA
- LVMH
- Ralph Lauren Corp

Also, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).

# Quick Update on my portfolio

Last week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn't know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there's a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.

I expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).

**TLDR:**

1. Vaccinations accelerating - J&amp;J vaccine approved
2. Herd immunity by end of April
3. UK re-opens - flight bookings surge 300%
4. Israel is re-opening
5. Reflation = good for airlines
6. $1.9T Stimulus
7. Codeshare program + Project Oasis
8. 80M shares short as of 02/12
9. Price Target = $60

**1.** **Vaccinations are accelerating**

* Pfizer will have provided 120M doses by the end of March, and 300M doses by the end of July.
* Moderna will have provided 100M doses by the end of March and 300M doses by the end of July.
* Johnson and Johnson is prepared to provide 20M doses by the end of March, and 100M doses in the first half of 2021
* This will translate to 130M Americans vaccinated by the end of March, and 200M Americans vaccinated by the end of April.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/02/23/pfizer-and-moderna-to-dramatically-increase-covid-19-vaccine-production-this-spring/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/02/23/pfizer-and-moderna-to-dramatically-increase-covid-19-vaccine-production-this-spring/?sh=1fb0f6d376c5)

**2. Herd Immunity by End of April**

* According to the CDC, only 1 in 4.6 COVID cases were actually reported: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html)
* According to the CDC, 28M cases have been reported in the US: [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases\_totalcases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_totalcases)
* Therefore, 28M x 4.6 = 128M people have already had the virus and are immune
* Therefore, 128M + 200M / 330M x 202M = 263M will be immune by the end of April. This is about 80% of the population.

**3. UK Re-Opens: Flight Bookings Surge 300%**

UK flight bookings surge: [https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/brits-rush-to-book-vacations-following-lockdown-announcement](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/brits-rush-to-book-vacations-following-lockdown-announcement)

As Bill Ackman states, there will be a surge in ""animal spirits"" when COVID restrictions ease causing people to schedule vacations and trips to elderly family members.

**4. Israel is Re-Opening**

Individuals with a ""Green Pass"" are able to access gyms, hotels, and theaters.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-int-idUSKBN2AL03U](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-int-idUSKBN2AL03U)

**5. Reflation = Good for Airlines**

As the economy re-opens, inflation will increase as Americans spend the money they have been saving. This will cause all prices connected to commodities to increase in price. So, even airline tickets will cost more, which means more revenue. Cramer has a great explanation on this: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/cramer-on-buying-growth-stocks-after-inflation-scare-shakes-up-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/cramer-on-buying-growth-stocks-after-inflation-scare-shakes-up-market.html)

**6. $1.9T Stimulus Package**

More than 150 CEO's including American Airlines CEO signed a letter to Congress to pass the $1.9T stimulus package on Wednesday. The package is set to pass the House on Friday or Saturday. This could provide a big stimulus directly to AAL.

**7. Codeshare Program + Oasis Project**

American Airlines' codeshare program between JetBlue and Alaskan Airlines allows customers to schedule flights through either airline on each other's websites. This creates a streamlined process for the consumer without having to book with multiple airlines and also provides American Airlines with an additional revenue stream.

While the pandemic hit, planes that weren't flying were being refurbished within Project Oasis. The newly renovated cabins may allow American Airlines to bounce higher than peers after the pandemic.

And, the short volume has increased substantially in the past three days... short interest could be over 150M as of tomorrow.

**9. Price Targets**

I believe AAL (13.96B) should be priced similarly to Southwest Airlines (35B) due to their unique positioning for a stimulus package and increased revenue from their codeshare programs. Therefore, with the increase in demand for all airlines stocks and to match the market cap of Southwest, I see a PT of $60 as being very possible. I think a short squeeze before March 19th can even get us there.

What exists, that isn’t a leveraged product, to provide that kind of correlation protection? If we set aside the insanity of this stock at this price for a minute, what if some big money looked at the data and decided that GME is a smart way to hedge their risk on a stock market at all time high, where bonds are just slicing their way higher at an alarming rate, losing money hand over fist? Add on to that, they get to tighten their grip around their competitors’ balls, squeeze them into folding, make a profit, plus get new clients at the same time.

According to the official data there are [530,807 AMC calls expiring this friday](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMC/options).

Similarly, there are [117,911 GME calls expiring this friday](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GME/options).

Since each contract represents 100 shares, if every one of these calls expires in the money **53 million shares of AMC will need to be bought and 11.7 million shares of GME will need to be bought in order to fulfill these contracts**.

According to [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/), AMC has a float of 136 million shares, while GME has a float 45 million shares.

_________

This means the % of the total shares that will need to be bought for each of these stocks are the following:

53M / 136M = **39% of float for AMC**


11.7M / 45M = **26% of float for GME**

In reality these percentages are higher since not all the shares are actually available to be purchased.

*If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes*

As we learned from the last spike to 483, it was **not** the shorts squeezing. *As Melvin* ***admitted*** *in the Congressional Hearing that they did* ***not*** *cover and the spike was from* ***gamma****.*

If you do not know, this ""gamma squeeze"" occurs because of call options. As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. 

So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.

There are *millions, and millions, and* ***millions*** of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. ***So many fucking shares.***

If we can get to 800 and *all these calls become* ***in the money*** the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.

The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.

If you did not read my last dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.*** 

Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, ***is what it predicted.*** 

*To reiterate:*

*I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop's share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the* ***M****other* ***o****f* ***A****ll* ***G****amma* ***S****queezes. Which will* ***then*** *trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.* 

Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on r/stocks 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme\_gamma\_squeeze\_part\_two/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/)

While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.

The thing that has kept inflation under control was that it went to rich people who let the stock market soak that extra cash up. But if the retail traders take that wealth out, it could start circulating and end up over-inflating the economy.

Now clearly I haven’t actually researched this or it would have the DD flair. It’s just something that I’ve been wondering about and if any autistics can help this retard understand why he’s wrong.

In the last hour of trading today, we saw large purchases of GME, EXPR, AMC, NAKD, SNDL stocks.

These purchases most likely came from the MM who bought due to the volume of Call/Put Options on the stock.

With the release of the Short Interest report to the public in the after-hours trading session, the MM took proactive steps to leverage risk. The MM has to hold a number of shares as they see fit to support volatility trading due to people's awareness of the short interest, the volume of stock trading, and other factors.

This chart shows a good example of the other factors.

1614232933.0|0.0|t3_lrzoey|151.0|"RKT - Earnings tomorrow and short interest is now at 41%!

Rocket mortgage reports earnings tomorrow after the bell. Rocket is currently the largest mortgage brokerage platform (Fintech) in the industry.  They currently have about 9% of the space and are projecting 25% within 5 years. 

Reports from the CEO teased that they are partnering with the largest financial institution. Rumor suggest Berkshire since they are the largest. Their partner ships with companies like Intuit have dramatically grown their revenues so I expect the “largest financial institution” to dramatically boost their forecasts. 

Nov 2020 their announced a 1 billion dollar buyback option that lasts 2 years.  I’m not sure they will need to execute the buyback but this shows the board of directors they are serious about killing off this short fund.  

Over the last 6 months this stock has been channel traded as hedge funds like BlackRock recently doubled their positions.  

It pattern trades 3-4 day spikes followed by 10-15 days declines with a solid support at $20. 

Today the short interest reported showed an increase to 41%.  With 5 days to cover.  This is insanely high.  

Let me preface I’m not advocating a squeeze im just simply giving my opinion on above news will cause. I believe RKT was attacked by the same short funds shorting all meme stocks as this was the darling back when it IPO’d in here and got smacked down by shorts.  Back then short interest was at mid 20’s when it spiked to $35.  

The big complaint was that 10 year treasuries were rising and inflation will kill mortgage stocks.  Powell spoke today and said they would try to keep rates low around 2% for a long time. 

Today’s housing report showed a surprise of 4% new home purchases vs .9% projected.  This is a huge beat and only fuels suspicions that Rocket will have a massive quarter report. 

Rocket has the best refinance / return customer of any company.  They have a 70% refinance rate because they track their customers logging In to their account.  The industry avg is 23%.  

The one downside is the 8% economic interest the A shares have.  If rocket grows their projected 25% market share then their value is somewhere around $40-$60 in my opinion.  If they maintain 10% market share then they shouldn’t be worth more than the $20 they have now.  Might be the reason a short hedge fund is piling on them to halt their growth.  Maybe a competitor.  Speculating so I digress. 

When looking at the chart.  Look at the strength at holding $20.  Is this a moon shot, probably not... However with the volatility happening in GME and AMC I believe any pressure put on RKT shorts will force them to cover while the market piles in because this is a damn good company being held down by a hedgie bastard."|wallstreetbets|Rocket Mortgage Earnings, Massive Partnership announcement and Buyback. 41% Short interest!|151.0|0.84

It is the most undervalued stock I’ve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife’s boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.

Listen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.

Last few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol’ titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that’s just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.

BB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it’s working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China’s google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV’s and use BB’s QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they’ll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry’s QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that’s just the beginning. No we won’t see profit this March because it is yet to boom. 

another product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it’s only one of their products. It’s a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.

IVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It’s basically an App store installed in AV’s, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don’t fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.

This is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.

DISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that’s why I yolo’d 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.

Also, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what’s on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.

Title already says it but for all ya smooth-brained monkeys: Please realize that trading halts are normal whenever there is an imbalance in orders. This goes both ways up and down. **And yes, this can also happen 10 minute before market close or whenever.**

However, I see too many people shouting ""MARKET MANIPULATION!!!"" or ""MY BROKER IS HALTING""... your broker isn't doing shit (unless you're RH, then restricting buy orders but allowing sells on you-know-what-day, in light of our newest information, is indeed manipulation).

But please stop stating that halting is done to stop a certain stock to rise and read up on the topic: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp)

*""Companies will often wait until the market closes to release sensitive information to the public, in order to give investors* ***time to evaluate the information and determine whether it is significant***\*. This practice, however, can lead to there b***eing a large imbalance between buy and sell orders*** *in the lead up to the market open. In such an instance,* ***an*** [***exchange***](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange.asp) ***may decide to institute a an opening delay, or a trading halt immediately at the market open***. *These delays are usually in effect for no more than a few minutes, until balance between buy and sell orders can be restored.""*

So please stop accusing your broker or anyone else of manipulation while there is just an imbalance in orders - this is done by the exchanges, not your broker. If you still think this is manipulation then please at least blame the exchange.

This is my first post. I’ve been trying to figure out how 140% short interest of GME can be covered so quickly all the way down to the current 30% short interest that is being reported online. 

So I heard that if an institution has 100 shares sold short they can also buy one deep ITM call to be neutral and report 0% short. 

So instead the hedge funds most likely bought long calls to make it look like they had cover their positions. Problem is if they buy far out the premiums are really expensive. So instead they probably bought short dated calls and when they expire they have to buy new ones otherwise the real short interest will be reported.

**What is GAN?**

GAN (“Game Account Network”) is a NASDAQ-listed B2B SaaS company providing product services to land-based casino operators that help lower customer churn and drive increased visits by consumers. Though the company may not be well known to US-based residents, the company has been operating for nearly 20 years in Europe and has global headquarters based in London. More recently, the company has targeted the United States as a growth area as individual states start to create regulated environments in which they allow online, real-money casinos to operate. Many states have started to legalize and regulate online gambling, the first being New Jersey in 2016, in which GAN has a partnership with Betfair. GAN now seeks to accelerate this growth in more states with additional partnerships and expanded product offerings. 

**Product Offerings**

GAN offers 6 total products, 4 of which will be covered below as they account for 90.2% of revenue (as of Q3’20) and have the clearest growth prospects. 

**Simulated Gaming**:  Simulated gaming allows users to play traditional casino games online, without the chance of winning real money. For casino operators, Simulated Gaming allows the operator to create an environment which users can play games in a market where real money gaming is not yet legal. While users may not have a chance to win money, casino operators can still entice users to play through special offers that drive them to their physical casino (e.g. play for X hours online and get a free night). Additionally, Simulated Gaming and Real Money Gaming run off the same back-end platform, meaning that any user data acquired during the simulated-phase is extremely valuable once the switch is “turned on” to allow for real bets to be placed. 

**Real Money Gaming**: Real money gaming is exactly as it sounds: Users deposit money and play games online with the chance of winning real money in return. GAN provides many of the same games you see inside casinos without the user having to be physically present. Real money gaming is still barred in most states, and like physical land-based casinos, online casinos are highly regulated, in which GAN’s software complies with all local regulations. 

**GameSTACK**: GameSTACK is the back-end software that ties everything together. Think of a highly specialized CRM system that serves as the technical hub of the player’s online gaming presence. Starting with the basics, the software tracks every time a user plays a game and every bet the user makes within the game, allowing operators of GameSTACK a rich pool of data to mine from. Additionally, the software includes a patented feature called iBridge (GAN recently licensed this IP to a client for $3MM) which allows players of online casinos to be linked back to land-based casinos loyalty programs. With the iBridge technology, land-based casino operators have high visibility to loyalty members online and offline playstyles, and can tailor personalized content, messages, and promotions to its users. 

**Tying the product offerings together**: GAN will typically enter a market with a land-based casino and offer GameSTACK and Simulated Gaming in anticipation of real money gaming becoming legal in the state at a later point. This works well for both GAN and the casino operator – GAN has a new client on their platform (sticky) and the casino operator can push messages and promotions to their users in the simulated gaming environment. For example, if a user is playing simulated gaming in a state where online gaming is not yet legal, the user may receive a promotion for a free night stay at the casino based on their play history. In addition, once online gaming becomes legal in the state, it just needs to be “turned on”. This means the casino can use the rich data pool that has been building during Simulated Gaming and tailor messages to push users to play online with real money or drive them to the physical casino. 

**Other product offerings**: GAN offers two other products that are not covered in detail. 1) Game Distribution/Publishing – GAN provides a service where it creates online versions of existing games for the license holder. Those games can also be distributed into the online casino world where GAN’s software operates. 2) RGS (Remote Game Server) – RGS allows developers who want complete control of their global distribution the ability to set up a unique instance of GameSTACK. With the private instance of GameSTACK, the developer can operate proprietary content in regulated and social markets while maintaining control of distribution and pricing. 

**How Does GAN Make Money?**

GAN has a revenue share model, meaning they take a small slice from every transaction that occurs on their platform. This ‘take rate’ varies between customers but generally lies somewhere between 5% - 7%. Think of GAN software as the toll booth, taking a little nugget each time someone places a bet. The better GAN’s customers do, the better GAN does.  

**What’s the Outlook?**

Okay – So GAN has a unique product offering in a market that is increasing in size as additional states pass betting/gaming legislation. (GAN estimates by the end of 2021 50% of all states will have passed sports betting legislation.) What has been making waves recently that gets investors excited about GAN? 

1) CoolBet – Did you notice how in the product description there was no talk about a major aspect all casinos have, sports betting? That’s because until very recently, GAN didn’t have a sports betting product that integrated into their software suite. In Q3 of 2020 GAN signed an agreement to acquire CoolBet, which closed the first week of 2021. If you’re not familiar with CoolBet, they provide a sportsbook similar to DraftKings or Fanduel. In Quarter 3, CoolBet had a trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue of $28 million and a CAGR of 46%. CoolBet’s revenue alone will nearly double GAN’s overall revenue. 

2) Wynn Agreement – GAN signed a 10 year agreement with Wynn Resorts in Michigan to power their online sports book and casino, known as WynnBET ([https://mi.wynnbet.com/](https://mi.wynnbet.com/)). Given the successful rollout, it seems likely that Wynn would continue to use GAN to power WynnBET in other states as legislation allows. 

3) Fast Growth in Michigan – When Michigan flipped the switch and allowed online casinos to go live on January 22, over the first 5 days Michigan had 17x the number of active player days compared to New Jersey. This quick rollout is a sign that GAN is gaining momentum and finetuning their marketing to ensure maximum revenue from day one. 

**Is Now a Good Time to Buy?**

Normally, this is the spot where I would present some common fundamental ratios, perhaps project future earnings, etc. There are two things that make this difficult for GAN:

1) The company has been listed for less than a year. There isn’t a ton of data fully integrated into brokerage firms yet.  

2) GAN and its competitors don’t make money. That’s right, GAN, Scientific Gaming, Draft Kings, Golden Nugget Online Gaming, and many other competitors do not make any money. That being said, some fundamental ratios, such as Price/Book (12.06) and Price/Sales (30.94) are in line with competitors or lower. Given DraftKing’s Price/Sales is around 80, GAN may still have plenty of room to run. And, for what it’s worth, the company also loses less per share ($-0.14) than SGMS ($-1.23) and DKNG ($-0.98).   
   
 

Given the company doesn’t make money yet, this is definitely a speculative play. However, knowing that we should see many more states legalizing online gambling and sports betting over the next two years, and there being a larger public interest in online gaming and sports betting, I’m wagering on accelerated growth. Current position: 5 shares, buying more after earnings call on March 25. 

**TL;DR:** GAN makes backend software that allows casino operators to extend their physical casinos online. Players deposit real money to play online and the casino has access to user data and can push promotions to drive incremental revenue. GAN provides a full software suite (simulated gaming, real-money gaming, sportsbook) and takes a share (5% - 7%) from each bet made on their platform. Recent reason for optimism: GAN acquired CoolBet (sportsbook) which roughly doubles their revenue and signed a 10 year agreement with Wynn Resorts.

What you have seen is short term momentum trading – and this has very very short legs as seen before and as its not a real short squeeze your upside is capped. 

\-	As per latest data 48m share are out on loan. This is slightly up from end of Jan. 

\-	BUT: the free float is now 430m shares after the company printed 250m of shares, Wanda converted B to A shares and sold them off and Silverlake converted their convertible to shares.

\-	Hence short is about 10% of float and given the trading volume it takes a whopping 0.2-0.3 days to cover the short

\-	They will print more shares and have a further 500m authorized

**2.	Fundamentally it’s a terrible company.** 

\-	AMC has never produced any FCF. It had 5bn of debt before COVID at relatively low interest payments.

\-	Due to COVID they had to raise an additional 1200m of debt at high cost. The last 100m loan from Mudrich Capital charged 17!!! %

\-	To stay alive they had to print stock at a rapid speed. Share count is not 4.5x pre COVID. It was trading below USD 10 pre covid. 

\-	Why would it trade above an implied USD 50 (at current share prices) Despite 1bn + extra debt?

**Background**

SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., operates 12 theme parks within the United States. They own the SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Water Country USA, Adventure Island, and Sesame Place brands. Seaworld was originally the family entertainment division of Anheuser-Busch, and was spun out to Blackstone in 2009 when Anheuser-Busch was acquired by InBev. In 2013 the company was IPO’d to the public.

In 2013, a documentary called Blackfish was released that was highly critical of SeaWorld and their Orca shows (Shows where humans and killer whales swim in a pool together). This caused a lot of negative publicity for SeaWorld. Attendance at their parks dropped 5% in 2015, and they “suffered an 84 percent drop in its net second-quarter income” in 2015 (1).

From 2016 to 2019 (before COVID) SeaWorld was consistently growing it’s operating profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1: Operating Profit from 2016 to 2019. We removed a one time $269 Million goodwill impairment charge from 2017 so that the graph is more clear. ](https://preview.redd.it/6162hu1yjkj61.png?width=621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=748e679920d5545dfab5fa6ca4f6eb175e591799)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2: Seaworld Price Chart. Drop from 2014 to 2015 corresponds to the blackfish documentary impact. The rise from the start 2018 to end of 2019 corresponds to the company becoming more profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/3mogvc62kkj61.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=419a650cd415723b39b66a2047579b80c8e0fb82)

[Figure 3: Screenshot from income statement with the difference from 2019 to 2016 in each category.](https://preview.redd.it/2rr4wiwhvjj61.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d82573b431019d6b0fa843574766508dd3e5e0ed)

When we look at the income statement for SeaWorld for 2016 through 2019, we can see that admission revenue was fairly flat. The main contributions to the increase in operating profit was the decrease in operating expenses, and an increase in Merch sales.

This looks like the increase in profitability from 2016 to 2019 was more the result of cuttingExpenses than it was getting more revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4: Seaworld’s Operating Profit and Interest expense. ](https://preview.redd.it/c40arpdsvjj61.png?width=585&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2c3d5d0cc95e16989392208e79d9a6067783a3f)

&amp;#x200B;

SeaWorld’s interest expense has a significant impact on it’s bottom line. In 2016 and 2017 their interest expenses were greater than their operating profit. Even assuming that profit in 2020 would equal 2019 levels, SeaWorld would be paying more than half their profits in interest expense.

Due to the covid 19 Pandemic, Seaworld was forced to borrow an additional 727 Million dollars at between **8.75% and 9.5%**, further increasing their interest expense.

They have also gone through a bunch of CEOS, and currently have an interim CEO. Thier most recent earnings call they only talks about survivial and a depressing drive through sesame street experience.

**Probability Of Bankruptcy**

SeaWorld Entertainment Market Capitalization is relatively stable at the moment as compared to the past year. SeaWorld Entertainment reported last year Market Capitalization of 2.03 Billion. As of 02/18/2021, Tangible Asset Value is likely to grow to about 2.3 B, while Free Cash Flow is likely to drop slightly above 103.8 M.

SeaWorld Entertainment Probability Of Bankruptcy is used to show its chance of financial distress over the next two years of operations under current economic and market conditions.

We used [Altman Z Score](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/credit/altmans-z-score-model/) to predict the probability of a firm going into bankruptcy within the next 24 months or two fiscal years.  According to Edward Altman algorithm based on five fundamental business ratios, Z score of SEAS is 0.3 which falls under distress zone resulting in a high probability of bankruptcy.   Additionally, we see a lot of actions from leadership to survive the pandemic such as raising more long term debts from their latest earning calls which would help to relieve their liquidity issue. However, we don’t see any long -term recovery actions to bump their business planned post covid from their latest earnings call which makes it still a big concern. As a result, we would rank the probability of  bankruptcy high to medium (80-85%)

&amp;#x200B;

**Positions**:

https://preview.redd.it/ygt0yziqwjj61.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e345ffca9471e83e2ad08892a23537a3204e70ca

Seaworld has earnings tomorrow 2/25 and is at an all time high. If the stock goes up and there isn't good news in the earnings, I **may** YOLO these:

EDIT: I deliberately posted the PLTR position because that's what I bought instead. I think buying anything bullish is straight up retarded, but the bearish stuff has wide bid-ask spread, and isn't as rewarding since it can't triple. so basically SEAS is a tendie free thing to avoid either way in my opinion, hence my lack of SeaWorld positions.

There is a lot of talk here and in the news that this is a pure retail generated spike in GME price. 

Q1: If this is the case and it’s no longer a squeeze, does this mean that this is purely generated by retail buying with the double down effect of stubborn retail refusing to sell until, what’s the term, the moon? 

Q2: Should this be the case, does that mean that the only thing that hold-or-die folks need to worry about is institutional entities coming in and buffing the buys with the ultimately goal of selling at a fixed dollar amount they are happy with and pulling out to take their profits? 

Q3: Should this occur, am I correct in thinking that the next wave of selling would come from what we call “paper hand” sellers afraid of deep space travel, bringing all of us down to earth never reaching the moon?

Q4: If retail wants the moon, and holding and buying is the only way up, is there a way retail can ever combat institutions buying and selling with retails continuous buy and hold? 

Q5: How does this end? How does a coordinated pull out occur for retail to ‘beat’ institutions if ultimately a major retail pull out will ultimately impact a late retailer holding?"|wallstreetbets|Serious GME questions, retail vs institutions -who has the stronger pull out game(stonk)!|41.0|0.8

I’ve joined a month ago only a few days before the movement made it to national news, thanks to this subreddit I increase my cash by 50% and now I can finally buy a tiny condo for myself ( price had been hiking way faster than I could save).

But whats more important, this subreddit brought me down from my high horse thinking I’m among the smart ones. I work in finance and I always believed that investments are for Wall Street not for us little people. I believed in only investing in value stocks and anyone who says otherwise will only loose money. I believed all that propaganda by Wall Street and my own education.

This subreddit showed me how wrong and ignorant I was. Before I joined here I already saw the name WSB for a while on various channels but I stopped thinking about it once I saw the word Reddit. The night that I joined here, 1/21 I think, I was instantly shocked by all the great DD and all the conviction I see in here. Wisdom from the mass is so much better than the wisdom by the few Wall Street golden boys.

Then when I saw all the donations people are making using their gains, I was almost in tears. The level of care far surpassed those established people who just make mindless tax deductible contribution to well established NGOs. Never had it occurred to me bringing lunches to store employees or tendies to a hospital would be a way to give back, but it is so so much better than donating it the way people are used to.

1614225742.0|0.0|t3_lrxnp5|28.0|"The first and only real estate company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: IIPR) focused on the regulated U.S. cannabis industry,[announced today results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/innovative-industrial-properties-q4-revenue-increases-110-to-37-1-million/), the fourth full year since IIP commenced real estate operations and completed its initial public offering in December 2016.

**Highlights**

- Generated total revenues of approximately $116.9 million, net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $64.4 million and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) of approximately $97.8 million, representing increases of 162%, 191% and 180% over 2019, respectively.
- Recorded $3.27 of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share and $5.00 of adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) per diluted share, representing increases of 61% and 53% over 2019, respectively.
- Declared dividends to common stockholders totaling $4.47 per share, a 58% increase over 2019.
- Closed on over $620 million in new acquisitions and additional investments at existing properties (including commitments to fund future development/redevelopment, but excluding transaction costs), including 20 new property acquisitions, expanding IIP’s footprint to 66 properties totaling 5.4 million rentable square feet in 17 states at year-end.

&gt;*A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a corporation that combines the capital of many investors to acquire income producing real estate. As a public company traded on the NYSE, we are uniquely positioned in the industry to access public capital markets. As a REIT, one of our most attractive attributes is that we must distribute through a dividend to our stockholders at least 90 percent of our taxable income.[Innovative Industrial Properties has paid consecutive quarterly dividends to our common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=IIPR).*

Imo, this is an excellent play for those who want exposure in the US Cannabis Industry without taking on too much risk. This company offers tremendous growth with impressive dividends.

IIPR partners with licensed operators across all products types: 
1) Cultivation
2) Processing
3) Distribution

The company owns approximately 70 properties located in 17 states totaling approximately 6million square feet 

...That’s alot of rent!

**Sale Leaseback Program**

Innovative Industrial Properties acquires freestanding industrial and retail properties from state-licensed medical-use cannabis operators. The properties are then leased back under long-term, absolute net lease agreements. They focus on well-capitalized companies that have successfully gone through the rigorous state licensing process and have been granted a license in the state where the property is located.

&gt;*We act as a source of capital to these state-licensed operators by acquiring and leasing back their real estate. This allows for the opportunity to redeploy the proceeds into core operations, yielding a higher return than they would otherwise get from owning real estate.*

EXAMPLE:
- Targeted deal size - $5 million to $30+ million
- Additional expansion capital available
- Lease term – 10 to 20 years
- Initial base rent – 10% to 16% on total investment (based on property underwriting)
- Annual base rent escalations – 3% to 4.5%
- Security deposit and corporate guaranty based on credit underwriting
- Transaction timeline – closing 30 to 60 days from signed purchase and sale agreement

&gt; “We look forward to beginning our long-term real estate partnership with IIP, and working closely with them to address our future real estate capital needs as we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives. With the continued expansion of Illinois’ medical-use cannabis program and the introduction of the regulated adult-use cannabis program next year, we are very well-positioned, with state-of-the-art cultivation and processing facilities and support from IIP to continue to enhance productive capacity of these facilities, to play a key role in the continued strong growth of the Illinois regulated cannabis industry.” (Joe Caltabiano - President)

~150,000 square feet of rentable space

[Grassroots/Curaleaf](https://www.grassrootscannabis.com/)(3) *2 under redevelopment*
&gt;“Partnering with a proven real estate capital provider was a logical choice for us, freeing up our capital to be redeployed into our operations, while at the same time securing funding for our expansion at the Litchfield property in anticipation of the introduction in Illinois of the adult-use cannabis program in a few short months. We thank the IIP team for moving quickly to address our real estate capital needs with a solution that works well for us, and we look forward to completing the significant expansion of our production capacity at the property to address the tremendous demand of patients and consumers of Illinois.” (Mitchell Kahn - CEO/Founder of Grassroots)

~500,000 square feet of rentable space (*80,000 under development*)

**Conclusion**

IIPR provides a ripe opportunity to invest in the cannabis industry while providing growth/dividends, *HOWEVER*, I personally think it is a bit overbought(98%). Closed right around ATH today of 222.082usd.

I am looking to swing trade here &amp; enter below 200usd with additional support around 180. (Anything under 200 is a buy imo) ...Buystops placed @ 225usd in case of bullish continuation. I plan to re-evaluate late dated calls if/when premiums start to drop.

**First** (technical) —&gt; 3/19/21 200 Ps @ 4.80

Sell ~190usd 

**Second** (fundamental) —&gt; 1/21/22 200 Cs (*will re-evaluate premium*)

I strongly encourage everyone to do their own DD and deepdive the management here, as I am not a Financial Advisor. Imo, IIPR is poised for significant growth.

If you're like me, and you probably are because this is WSB circa a few million new members, none of the math means fuck all to you. You're buying a lottery ticket.

A lot of the people talking about holding forever have 3 shares and that's cool, no disrespect to those guys, but they have ~1k riding on this. If you're playing with actual money don't get greedy and don't get swept up in the hype and excitement. 

I ate my ~70% losses, reinvested the rest, and plan on getting out of the market for good once I make my initial amount back or lose everything (it's too stressful for me; migraines, my eye wouldn't stop fucking twitching and I couldn't sleep) so I'm clearly the biggest retard of the bunch. This isn't a call to sell, it's a call to not invest emotionally. I got swept up, put down more than I was comfortable losing, and here we are. Don't be me. Think about what you're doing and don't jump in with both feet and a real doll in each arm.

If you wanna hold then godspeed you glorious chromosomially challenged bastard. I'm not trying to say sell, get out, etc. All I want to do by screaming into the void is get people to think about what amount is enough. Don't change your exit amount every time the stock goes up or you'll get left with the bag. It's better to secure some than get left with nothing - unless you truly don't care about losing it, then hold that shit harder than I hold my wife's boyfriend's penis.

What’s up retards, back with a hot take on a nice little company. This time Apple. Last time I was here I called Snap (while it was at $15) adding targeting marketing so at least take some time and try and poke holes in this pipe dream.

Fundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means: 
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/safari-for-ios-14-and-macos-11-how-to-prevent-websites-from-tracking-your-moves-online/

Signs that desire for early adoption is high: 
https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-apps-from-tracking-you-across-sites-ios/

Apples self-claimed results:
https://searchads.apple.com/

ios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses, marketers and e-commerce. That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they’ve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.

Ie, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.

Or, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don’t do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you’re browsing.

No more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)

So, that’s concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.

Simply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you’re talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren’t even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.

All in all, you’d now spend $15000 for the same thing you would’ve paid $900 for previously (unless you’re part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.

While tracking isn’t the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn’t about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.

Why the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn’t happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a “privacy play” Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.

With this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that’s geared to fight the number four most valuable.

What does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren’t making the move for publicity or branding. That’s not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they’d be fighting it.

Following this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.

Well, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.

Additionally, Apple doesn’t historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. 

Want another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn’t even get scratched. Literally said “fuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill”

Apple didn’t care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you’re on their platform.

But currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That’s it. They don’t get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can’t take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That’s not something they’re gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You’ve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you’ll soon see Apple swing with punch two.

But before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.

So why would Apple finally pull the trigger?

Because for years they’ve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where’s it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.

That is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That’s a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.

What’s the difference that makes Apple so different? They don’t want to spend your whole budget unless they’ve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that’s not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they’ve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don’t control is the ads inside those apps.

The five obvious big plays here.

👉 Mobile game ads

Game ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.

Imagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.

👉 Ads for kids

Finally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can’t give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.

👉 Safe for work toggle

Finally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.

👉 Apple News 

Now, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it’s not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.

But oh don’t worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.

👉 Privacy

Another major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.

Now, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they’ve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.

To put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.

Secretly for years they’ve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.

Even without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.

Realistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.

So if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let’s look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they’re doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.

Stripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That’s a P/E ratio of 255%

Currently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.

From a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.

Finally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they’re doing all this because they’re introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.

Now finally we can cover the aspect that we don’t have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.

There’s a major war brewing and it’s only begun. But we’ve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don’t get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.

This company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.

Disclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.

All this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it’s in Facebook hands. 

What company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.

If you set a stop loss for anything above $45.10, RH will give you a warning that it is a ""High Stop Price"". Shown here: https://imgur.com/a/UuKz9a8

I played around with it to find that the cut-off point seems to be $45.10. Shown: https://imgur.com/a/dslKg1t

What does this mean? RH might be trolling or...we've found the number that shorts want, that being $45.10 is their desired price target. But the stop loss cannot possibly be high at $45.20 when the stock is currently $168.

When  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They'd have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn't want to make their living recording cool  music all day?

I was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I'll never forget.  They told me, ""you don't make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \*selling the dream of opening a  studio.""\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people's home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.

Let's  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There's going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that's too much for my small brain. To try and \*time\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it's a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don't have the  brain for it.

One thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn't  \*matter\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn't \*matter\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.

We  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered ""not essential"" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.

I am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I'm more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.

**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**

Reasons:

**1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**

**2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**

**3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**"|wallstreetbets|Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?|21.0|0.6

For over a decade Palantir has insisted they wouldn't go public. Their private equity has been locked up and those employees saw no light at the end of the tunnel. This created a very robust secondary market for their shares. This exists for a ton of companies, but Palantir has been particularly strong. Offerings for blocks of shares would come up every few months for their private stock, every year, for ten years.

So a ton of stock is held by private individuals (like myself) who purchased it years ago via a secondary market. And the process of getting that stock into our hands is a drawn out one. We got 20% when the stock first listed, and that took about two weeks to fully reconcile. This second round of 80% people are allowed to sell started being released the day of as well (about a week ago) and is still running through the hoops of being released to all the buyers. 

In effect, the sell off started a week ago (and really the anticipation of the release started things earlier) and will likely continue for a week as investors continue to get access to their funds.

They have been up to shenanigans behind the scenes (perhaps selling to each other back and forth and not covering their 🩳🩳) to help drive the stock price down.  As they do this, paper handed suckers get scared and sell and help drive it down. But luckily, due in large part to the 💎👐🏻🦍🦍, the price hasn’t gone down to where they need it to be to not be fucked. So then they wait and stop the shenanigans. And then eventually, like the current round 2, the 🦍🦍 will drive the price back up. My guess is that the 🦔🦔 will allow it to rise a bit then restart their shenanigans in hope of getting 🦍🦍 to sell. They will continue to periodically allow the price to increase but then will always do their shit behind the scenes to drive it down in the hopes that 🦍🦍 develop paper hands if it goes on long enough and eventually they will leave the stonk and the price will drop enough for them to manage their 🩳🩳. They think they can play this game longer than we can. We will have to play this back and forth game for quite a while if we want to see the curiosity rover first-hand on Mars.

You know, that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla (who doesn’t have one these days?) after 400-500 km. Let’s not forget a battery’s purpose is to stores energy. The more energy you can store in a smaller battery, the happier we humans are. Energy=happiness.

Finding a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology. According to the legend, anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler. According to the present technology, anyone who could develop a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery would rule the EV world.

A few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid-State Batterys. Instead of LI-ion, Solid-State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. For the ones who never heard about these, use Opera or Google to DYOR.

Solid-State Batteries promise, already today:

\- Twice the energy  
\- 1/100th of the size  
\- 6x faster charsing  
\- 10X longer lifetime  
\- Non-flammability

This new piece of 21th-century-technology will definitely evolve coming years. Elon Musk already called it the MOAB.

Now let’s talk stocks. A few companies are working on a Solid-State Battery, expecting to bring it to the market within a few years. Today, much of the development work on solid-state batteries is performed with partnerships. Among the players are conventional Li-ion battery-cell manufacturers (i.e., Samsung SDI, LG Chem, A123 Systems), battery separator technology solutions suppliers (Asahi Kasei), and materials suppliers (Solvay, Umicore, etc.).

QuantumScape  
Panasonic  
Samsung  
LG  
Ionic Materials  
BMW Solid  
Power  
Toyota  
Ilika

According to Yole Développement’s market forecast, mass production of solid-state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1% of Li-ion battery demand by 2025. This might explain the relative low interest from investors today, which might change when large solid-state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built.

Samsung, LG, BMW etc are all searching for the Solid-State battery for own use, so that is not interesting for me to invest in; they already reached their market share. Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you: Quantumscape and Ilika.

You might have heard about QuantumScape before. QS went to the moon ($10- $130) when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20% stake in the battery manufacturing company (crazy times on the stock market back in the days). Now QS is stable between $40 - $50. Fair price for a company with no revenue, but a huge potential in the EV market. QS is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen, Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros. Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries, trading around $3-$4. Ilika has has two development programs:

\- Stereax: miniature batterys for MedTech

\- Goliath: solid-states for the EV and other battery-powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries. Compared to QS and to see what’s happening with their stocks, lets only focus on the EV market. Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid-State Battery in 2026, that’s the same period as the planning of QS. Ilika actually plans a pre-pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024. For more information, DYOR.

So why is ILIKF trading $2-$4 and QS $40-$50?

Founded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value. Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return. QuantumScape’s prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros’s Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$.

Looking at their financials and progress, QS and Ilika do not differ that much. They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5-7 years, and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025. To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production.

The difference is QS plans to build a giga-factory to manufacture their batteries, which asks for a huge investment (0,5 billion – 750 million per GWh). That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital. Ilika has chosen a different route. They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh. UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge (FBC), a Government programme to fast track the development of cost-effective, high-performance, durable, safe, low-weight and recyclable batteries. Therefor Ilika doesn’t need the same capital investment to fund their growth.

So here is the point. Solid-State Battery technology is the future of battery. Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market. Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term. What are your thoughts on this? Is Ilika a good investment?"|wallstreetbets|Solid State Battery-tech/stock|37.0|0.76

The pandemic brought upon an emphasis on online retail car sales and home deliveries as dealerships went on lockdown throughout the country. The cancellation of nearly all auto shows; idling car factories across the country for two months, engineers working remotely, and car giants like Ford and GM converting into face shield and ventilator manufacturers.

&amp;#x200B;

Car dealers showed flexibility by adopting online sales and home deliveries, pulling the digital car-buying experience ahead by years and likely making it permanent.

A certain stonk is up a zillion percent and my dick is harder than it has ever been.(Viagra and Blue Rhino combined don’t have shit on this.)

I would like to take this opportunity to do something useful.

I’m going to explain to you: **Volatility Halts.**

Because many of you ‘tards see a ten minute halt or fifteen minute suspension and you’re like**“Oh No ThEy’Re DoInG iT aGaIn!!!”**

I grant that we were, quite recently, proper fucked by hedges and Big Broker. That injury is fresh in our minds and the trauma will not soon be forgotten.

But this is something else. This is not Robinhood bending you over while your wife’s boyfriend watches. This is standard SEC procedure.

But before I explain that, allow me a sidebar.

Some of you are complaining that they halted it until 4 p.m.- at such a time you are unable to trade. May I ask you something?

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU STILL DOING WITH ROBINHOOD?

YOU HAD AN ENTIRE FUCKING MONTH TO FIND A NEW BROKER AND MOVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR SHARES OVER!!!

I want you to go to the mirror, slap yourself in the face, and say “This is why your mother doesn’t love you.”

Then I want you to go to your computer, your phone, your tablet - whatever - AND GET A BETTER FUCKING BROKER.

**Back to volatility halts.** These are also called Circuit Breakers Halts.

When a stock moves more than 10% in any direction in a 5 minute period, the stock gets halted. These halts are in 5 minute increments. Usually they are no longer than 15 minutes. If a stock is halted after 3:40 p.m. (*eastern - of course*), it will remain halted until the market closes.

Volatility halts don’t occur during extended hours. Volatility halts are not the SEC (or NYSE or NASDAQ or AMEX) trying to fuck you. This is so they can sort out order flow, make sure everyone is filled at their desired price, and proceed from there.

Sometimes a stock will get halted and open higher. Sometimes it will open lower. This is because once all the orders that occurred *before* the halt get sorted, limit orders that weren’t already filled still exist. They determine the spread when the stock is unhalted.

Additionally, there are thousands of traders watching the stock and they pile back in the moment it’s unhalted (sometimes) causing the price to continue its moves or cool down, as the case maybe.

**TLDR: Circuit breaker halts (aka volatility halts) are a normal part of trading. It’s not anyone trying to fuck anyone. Calm down. Study up.**

EDIT:Thank you so much for all the love!Also did a little formatting changes and clean up.I'm glad to help! It is truly what I love to do and I'm glad to be doing it.

CLARIFY SOMETHINGS THAT KEEP COMING UP:

* Yes, it was halted several times the first time around (Volatility Halts)
* Yes, the NYSE did the halting. Whatever exchange a security trades on, that exchange is responsible for enforcing the rules the SEC makes
   * The SEC makes the rules
   * The exchanges enforce the rules
* Circuit breaker halts DO NOT OCCUR during extended hours trading. So, if it's halted at 15:57, it will be trading again at 16:00.
* One particular piece of shit has compelled me to add even further because they're a fucking neckbeard who will find ONE fucking example of how you're wrong and use it to justify their dumbfuck position. 
   * Yes, this particular cunt is the kind of bitch that finds infinite turn hacks in Magic: The Gathering and mills your deck while you stare at the clock.
   * This person probably has a very small dick and a very big bush.
   * They don't have a girlfriend. 
      * So they probably don't have a wife's boyfriend. 
      * My guess is they are the one who bought at $500 and sold at $50
      * I won't name names, but I'm sure you can find them in the comments. 
   * THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIERS OF VOLATILITY HALTS
      * depending on types of securities
      * depending on the velocity of the price moves
      * contingent on time frames
      * and number of halts during certain time frames
      * and the time of day. 
      * THESE TIERED HALTS BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY AND HAVE DIFFERENT RULES

I have work to do, so I can't keep answering Questions. Please feel free to use the search engine of your choice to investigate Circuit Breaker Halts in greater detail. My favorite is [ask.com](https://ask.com).

One more thing. **If you read nothing else in the post,**

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term 🚀🚀, long term = big ⬇️. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. 

Before I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards

Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.

First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.

Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second. 
Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later.
Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). 
Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'.
Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong.
Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. 

Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood ähem ähem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.

There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. 
For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. 
However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.

So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. 

In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. 

So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a 🌈🐻 I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.

Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday

**From Wikipedia:**

The J. M. Smucker Company, also known as Smucker and Smucker's, is an American manufacturer of jam, peanut butter, jelly, fruit syrups, beverages, shortening, ice cream toppings, and other products in North America. Smucker's headquarters are located in Orrville, Ohio. It was founded in 1897.

**Diversification:**

Smuckers is well diversified, carrying fruit spreads, peanut butter, ice cream toppings, syrups, etc.

They've done well to integrate themselves into the ""organic"" craze with their ""Natural Fruit Spreads"" line.

Uncrustables gives them an entry into the ""standalone product"" sector and, let's be honest, regardless people aren't going to stop buying peanut butter and jelly.

Their fruit syrups are a staple at many commercial outlets like Denny's (not sure on this one but definitely similar restaurants) and ice cream shops. Speaking of ice cream shops, their ""Magic Shell"" frozen chocolate topping is great for making a Wendy's style cone.

Let's also not forget the Jif brand, also owned by J.M. Smucker Company, which sells a variety of peanut butter and other assorted products. Take a look at Jif to go, for example.

**The Point:**

Smuckers isn't going anywhere, any time soon. They already have the infrastructure in place - factories are built, distribution is established, they are carried in retailers across the world, and they sell good shit.

**The Valuation:**

Volatility is high and after a nearly 50 year bull run, is now at a consolidation period. This is, in my opinion, a good time to get in to an American company with growing volume. Things could go either way, but personally I've accumulated a few hundred shares over the past couple months.

*Do your own diligence.*

Though it was only a month ago, /u/TheEmperorOfJenks transformed himself into a eternal meme here on WSB that ripples to this day. The man who [lost his life savings on ornamental gourd futures.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/) This is one of the strangest and most hilarious ways I’ve seen someone YOLO, so I decided to follow the story for the next month. What happened after that has kept me in utter awe. Within a month, losing his ass on gourdy bois might actually be the least autistic thing he’s done in 2021.

Since he had to take physical possession of so many of these gigantic, worthless gourds, he tried his best to make lemons into lemonade. He first investigated [how to make them into instruments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gourds/comments/l0o9za/market_potential_for_gourd_instruments_in_great/)Then, he fully embraced the autist inside him and began to eat his loss. Literally. [He found a way to eat ornamental gourds,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gourds/comments/ld1p3z/ive_found_out_how_to_make_gourds_edible/) which could only be done by boiling them for 3+ hours. I’m pretty sure you can eat fence posts with this method as well.

After eating gourds and likely getting massive constipation, he tried his hands at sportsbetting. In a now deleted post, [he said he had a straight up bet of $1,000 for the Kansas City Chiefs to win the Super Bowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/leyru3/there_is_absolutely_no_way_kansas_city_will_lose/). This was the last of his money.

Then, he had a brilliant idea. A magnum opus to follow his gourds bet. Rhodium. As one might expect from someone who ruined their financial future to god damn gourds, [he declared that Rhodium was going to hit $40k in 2 months, after it just mooned to $20k](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lac1oy/rhodium_is_skyrocketting_invest_now_for_ultimate/) It’s the classic buy high sell low strategy. In reality, [the price has only gone up 15%](https://www.metalsdaily.com/live-prices/pgms/) a full 85% under his prediction. So he went full retard.

Using a credit card, [he bought 8.5 grams of what he was told was Rhodium for $4,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lac1oy/rhodium_is_skyrocketting_invest_now_for_ultimate/glodjo5/) And then it gets fun.

As Rhodium rocketed up a startling 2%, instead of buying a Lambo, [he asked where he could buy a custom water bed with his expected windfall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lajuas/where_to_buy_custom_water_beds/) It literally couldn’t go tits up.

[Then his “Rhodium” arrived.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lckk4r/my_rhodium_just_arrived/) But instead of looking like a polished, precisely packaged piece of metal, like other precious metal commodities, he got a lump of discolored metal in a plastic bag. The commenters of /r/Bullion immediately questioned its authenticity. So, he went to the experts. [He went to What Is This Rock with his $4,000 investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is_this_rhodium/) Everyone commented that it was bunk and likely pyrite. When asked where he bought it, [he gave a link to a shady Slovakian version of Wish](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisrock/comments/lfhu93/is_this_rhodium/gmndl5v/), clearly the experts in precious metal futures. Shockingly, the listing was now gone, along with the storefront on the super trustworthy .sk site.

Then, a trip to a local metals store in Tulsa confirmed it. [He paid $4,000 for a worthless piece of pyrite.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bullion/comments/lktedl/it_wasnt_rhodium/) He has gone post silent since then, but the damage is there. Since losing $10k to gourds, he lost another $5k on sportsbetting and a precious metals scam. [He states that he is now moving to Uruguay to start over.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

I, for one, cannot wait to see the next chapter in this story. When we see Spanish newspaper articles about an American in Uruguay who went $500,000 in debt betting against freshwater eel futures, we know who is responsible.

### Very Electric

&gt;According to the manufacturer, a 12-MW turbine can generate 67 GWh annually, or enough electricity for about 16,000 European homes, and avoid up to 42 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The first orders for the new machine have already been placed, coming from SSE Renewables and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) for the Dogger Bank offshore complex in the North Sea. Also, Denmark’s Ørsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED) has selected the Haliade-X turbine for the 120-MW Skipjack project off Maryland and the 1.1-GW Ocean Wind complex off New Jersey.

Oshkosh wins USPS contract, Microvast will be supplying their EV for next 10 years+

So 100% of the USPS contract was awarded to $OSK as a 10 year binding contract to make up to 165,000 vans. The USPS is initially investing $482 so Oshkosh can ""finalize the production design of the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) — a purpose-built, right-hand-drive vehicle for mail and package delivery"" (1) They can already produce the ICE vehicles, so this investment is to enable them to produce EV in house

Oshkosh invested $25M in Microvast (THCB) and announced a joint development agreement with Microvast. A JDA is pretty much we will work on a project together. This is the project (the USPS vehicle). I believe that once Oshkosh has the means to produce EVs, that is what they will provide. This is where the industry and society is going, eventually... 

According to Postmaster General Louis Dejoy, their 10 year plan (which mostly has to do with Oshkosh and Microvast making those platypus looking vans) will strengthen them as an entity, he had this to say today (3)

 ""The key commitments of this plan will include:

1. A commitment to six- and seven-day a week delivery service to every address in the nation, not just because it is the law—but because it is a key ingredient to our future success.
2. A commitment to stabilizing and strengthening our workforce—especially for our associates who are not yet in a career position.  We want every postal employee to have the tools, training, and supportive environment necessary to enjoy a long-term career with us. 
3. A commitment to investing in our network infrastructure, including vehicles, technology, and package sortation equipment.  We demonstrated this commitment with our  award yesterday, and look forward to working with Congress to determine if our electric vehicle goals can be accelerated.""

These are three huge statements that I believe are achievable. Part of this plan is replacing their entire fleet, which has been around for 25-32 years. They want to increase their ability to reach rural homes (where ICE vehicles may be more viable), and ""invest in network infranstructure... our electric vehicle goals can be accelerated"". 

This is playing out exactly as I've predicted over the last couple months. I was pleasantly surprised to learn about Oshkosh when the DA was announced. Now we are here, it's huge. If you hold this for multiple years, this could be a 5-10 bagger, and I'm all in! Disclosure and disclaimer: i have 6500 warrants and 1000 shares and 50 shares of $OSK and I got 0 $WKHS XD

Earnings tomorrow BMO 

Why? 

**Options priced to PERFECTION** - The way the options are priced, literally a 1% move up in the stock will net about 30%+ gains on the options. 

Volatility is EXTREMELY low even though they have earnings tomorrow. Yes the stock hasn’t made dick swinging moves recently but it has the potential - swung from $225 to $265 in 5 trading sessions in May 2020 - it CAN move.  

**Theta** - these options are 3 weeks out. CHEAP. They will not go to 0 on a miss. 

**Total market move** - I know you’re all scared of a stonk crash thanks to Dr. Michael Bublé but remember, bears are usually early, and he got bent over backwards for months and months. 

JPOW is firing up the printer, humans love round numbers - SPY 400 confirmed. Psychological barrier will be broken. 

These options have 3 weeks to flow with the market to highs. Plus telecoms and real estate are inflation hedged... combine telecoms and real estate into one stock and you get super inflation hedged - AMT baby 

**Technicals** - stock is beaten up and looks to have formed a bottom for a reversal. Currently bull flagging. Weekly ready to form a bullish engulfing after earnings. (I can visualize it) 

**Stocktwits** - page is full of complaining and bag holding longs - my favorite recipe for a banger move - because while they break even on the move up, you rake in the tendies. 

I actually like the stock, always had an eye for it. Everything lined up.

She has been working from home so her daily consumption of coffee has been home based, although some purchase occasions have taken place at SBUX and they have remained relevant and even competitive. 

The best part is, this isn’t even just a Becky play, it is a reopening play. More people in airports = more SBUX purchases. More people in malls = more SBUX. More people going to the office = way more SBUX.

Rates of savings (for the Starbucks crowd) has more than doubled since March of 2020 (12% to 32%) according to US Bureau of Economic Analysis. All of this cash is burning a hole in Becky’s knockoff LULU pants.

SBUX plans to open 1,100 new stores by EOY. More than half of those in China. Getting that sweet RenMinBi.

So I started hording some stocks and found once you get 100 you can now sell covered calls.  This is basically finding someone else who wants the option to buy your stocks at a set price and will pay you a little bit for that privelege. 

This is where I don't understand how it's not a great deal.

Let's say AMC you have 200 shares.  Doable with a $1500 investment.   You can sell a call for $9 and $12 ending this Friday and make $32 &amp; $11.  So in one week you made $43.  That's almost a 3% gain in a week.  You can do this every week.  $43 * 52 = 2,236.  With a $15k investment you can make $1600/month before taxes in passive income... 

The downside is 🚀 and AMC jumps to $20 or more in any given week. You lose out on a potential $4000 worth of stock and the sweet karma, but both options would exercise and you would get 100*9 +100*12 = $2100 + $43 premium.

I didn't expect this post would quickly turn into a debate about raising federal minimum wages to $15. When I read the minimum wage clause I was thinking more along the lines of impacts to small and medium business and how that affects stock market performance of, say, Dow Jones Small Cap Index. Somehow I did not include this thought in my original post. Or perhaps the relief bill is focused on providing assistance to the grassroot and therefore only tangentially related to the stock market. I apologize if there is any confusion or unpleasant exchange. All comments (except those violating WSB rules) are still welcome. 

====================

The Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion relief package will be brought to the floors of House and Senate soon and with Democrats holding majority in both chambers there seems to be no issue passing it. Just want to have some discussion with fellow WSB investors about the impact of the package on stock market.  I understand that WSB is no political forum and I will try to make political discussions at the minimum, but inevitably some gauging of the administration’s pork barreling is needed.

Some of my own thoughts:

\-The package seems to represent a pivot from the Fed (monetary policy) to Treasury (fiscal policy) as the center for economic relief and recovery. The market seems a bit concerned that fiscal policy could trigger inflation, that Fed might gradually withdraw from asset purchases and that the Fed might even be pressured to raise interest rates prematurely. Treasury yields shot up and institutional investors capitalized on it, dumping equities in the past two days. Now, I don’t think Fed will reduce asset purchases and suppress interest rates soon, but the market is quite sensitive to any attempt that could be interpreted as trying to poke the “bubble” on the stock market. I would expect more roller-coaster dramas in the coming weeks as more details of the bills are revealed.

\-The package is labeled as a “relief” bill and most of the media coverage I’ve read focuses on direct payments, child support, unemployment relief, child tax credit etc. but I am more concerned about what sectors could benefit from the bill. The recent announcement of USPS truck contract, while not part of the package, suggests the administration might use the package to send favors to specific sectors such as renewable energy and EV. From what I read there are also supports for health insurance premiums and transit systems, although I am not sure if that would have any substantial impact on relevant sectors.

\-I do agree that inflation could be a concern with such a big fiscal package, and I am looking for good options to hedge against it. One post I’ve seen suggest buying value stocks, but I am suspicious as stocks are generally not considered hedging options. I do buy physical silver and gold, but I wonder if there are any better suggestions.

\-The package also includes a $15 minimum wage clause and Biden is trying hard to sell it. All politics aside, I am genuinely not sure if this would damage employment rate and offset all the unemployment and small business relieves in the bill. I pledge ignorance on this issue and I await more enlightened views."|wallstreetbets|Relief Package and Implications for Stock Market|25.0|0.78

Raytheon ($RTX) is a high-end precision weapons manufacturer (read: expensive) with what were previously considered substantial contracts to NATO and the lot. This all changed when [Lloyd J. Austin III](https://www.defense.gov/Our-Story/Meet-the-Team/Secretary-of-Defense/) was appointed to the current SECDEF role in the USA. Politics aside, dude has a big long resume, with one extraordinarily particular accolade that is immediately relevant: he has just left an *incredibly* lucrative position as a Board Member for Raytheon. I doubt Mahatma Gandhi would let that job go easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets real:

Raytheon designed and produced 2 key components of the F35 program: the missile delivery system, and the missiles themselves (plus much more, such as Tomahawk cruise missiles). The F35 program is well known to have cost over **$1 trillion,** and Raytheon snagged the most renewable element of it. Now, theres a catch to this as the F35 hasnt been used very extensively in combat yet. If you count gross flight hours as a return on investment, the F35 has not nearly reached a net positive for NATO - yet.   


The other big thing, is that the F35 (and by extension RTX) have not yet been tested against the Russian-made air defence system, the S-400: Turkey was kicked off the program for wanting to try. This means that the NATO crown jewel has yet to actually been shown off, and Raytheon, if their products are successful (tend to be) would receive a big heap of kudos. This event seems unlikely in this time of relative global peace except for a few key points:

&amp;#x200B;

* Iran uses the S-400 and is developing nuclear weapons - something undesirable to Israel and NATO, and military coercion is 100% an option on the table
* America and NATO desperately need a ROI on their $1tn
* The global economy has massively contracted, and war is very good for market stimulation

tl;dr at the bottom

Why it'll  🚀this year and next year:

1) Biden wants to make the entire US fleet EV by the end of his term. You really think he's going to buy $70,000 cybertrucks for the fleet? Can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy Teslas while the average American has to buy regular cars? I think Biden will be more likely to buy GM's newer electric cars once they come out because they'll be much cheaper. Biden also drives GMs cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there. I don't think it's a coincidence that GM announced going fully electric while Biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet. Either Biden knew GM was going electric or GM knew Biden would make this big purchase order.

2) Cap and trade? Have you heard of it? No? You should learn about it or else you'll lose out on tendies.  Cap and trade is complicated so I'm not gonna explain it here. Go google it. Point is, companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less CO2 compared to a gas car. In fact, Tesla would've **lost money** in 2020 if it wasn't for California's cap and trade program ([https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/tesla-profitability/index.html)). Now that GM has access to this cap and trade market, they'll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies. This will also hurt Tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become. 

Also, you know who's likely to pass cap and trade? The federal government. Obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Clean\_Energy\_and\_Security\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act)), but it was never brought to the senate. With climate change being a more pressing issue, and Biden's talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs, he's for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level. He's also publicly supported cap and trade ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/)). From his campaign website ""And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal, including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line."" This seems to refer to cap and trade as it's the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal. With democrats controlling everything, cap and trade is likely to pass this time. 

Then again, politicians lie all the time and  Biden isn't much different. However, even if the feds don't step in, multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come. 

3) GMs cars are comparable to Tesla's cars.  The Model 3 isn't actually that good. The Chevy Bolt has a range of 259 miles, about 22 miles longer than Tesla. Both cars cost about the same amount. The newer Chevy Bolts also have fast charging, so Tesla's starting to lose its moat here. Guess Elon's plan to not patent anything really screwed him over.

4) The PE on this is stupidly low. Come on? 12.13? It's practically **begging** to be bought at this price. Compare this to Tesla's 1,230. If GM and Tesla, both EV companies, had the same valuation, GM would be worth $5000. This is my price target lmao.

5) The UK, Norway, and other countries are planning to ban vehicles. Norway is the most aggressive at 2025. China is also considering it, which would make EV companies like GM go absolutely parabolic. GM has the Chevy Bolt, meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing EVs.

Why is the stock down?

There are a lot of things that make people scared of GM. Here's why I think they're dumb:

1) The chip shortage:

This is a concern for GM in the short run, but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019. Currently they're projecting the earnings will be $1-$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage. I think that's a worst case scenario and the market is **overreacting** to the chip shortage. The chip shortage is now getting the concern of Congress and Biden ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/23/biden-semiconductor-shortage-meeting/)). Given that Biden always talks about manufacturing, funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win. He can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever. GM gets its chips from Qualcomm, which has a ton of facilities in the US and is based in San Diego. This can serve as an easy political win for Biden. 

2) Charging stations. This isn't going to be a concern for much longer. Most people don't drive for long haul journeys, so driving stations aren't really needed. Think about it. If you could fill up your car with gas at home, would you ever go to a gas station? Very rarely. This is the point of EVs, and it's why I think they'll be the future. Also I hate to mention Biden again, but he's planning to put 500,000 public charging stations in the US by 2030. This won't be a problem much longer. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-02/joe-biden-plan-to-fight-climate-change-could-sell-25-million-electric-cars))

3) bEaR mArKEt. Chill. This shit happens every couple of months. People panic and say the market is crashing. It's not. Even if it was, GM would hardly be hit because its PE is so stupidly low. IMO the only company that should tank a ton is Tesla. People always bring up the **bUfFeT inDicAtoR** because they think Buffet is some kind of god. He's not. Sometimes Buffet is an idiot. He doesn't understand the tech industry, and I think the rise in stocks recently is tech related. We're entering a new era of American capitalism where tech companies dominate. 7% stock market growth is the norm. With GDP rising 2% per year, you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run. The buffet indicator only measures GDP too, which isn't remotely the same as stock prices. Stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns. GDP doesn't factor wealth into consideration at all. 

One last point: people think it's a buy and hold for 10 years, but it's not. I think GM will go to the moon ($5000) quicker than you think. Stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations. There are a lot of catalysts incoming (charging stations, no new gas cars, chip production, and cap and trade). If any one of these things are announced, that's GM to $100. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Buy GM. Cap and trade, EV ban, and its undervalued price make it super attractive. GM will hit $5000. Buy or cry.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhz1ej/fcx_ddcopper_is_in_a_breakout_from_recent_highs/

My main point was that FCX, the worlds biggest copper miner, completely deviated from the index and that it was going to spring back to match it. **It did, and popped 20%.**


Due to the market chaos this week the same exact set up is there again.

For reference use this

https://m.investing.com/commodities/copper-streaming-chart

FCX peaked on 2/22 at 38.99 and is down 5% since then while copper is up 2.4%.


We are looking at a 7% swing here, and copper is looking so bullish its actually insane. We are most likely gonna hit all time highs at this rate. Every day will start red and end up green bigly. If copper has a big day this week then an even bigger pop is gauranteed.


Now no one listened to me and called me stupid last time, hopefully that changes.
