&gt;Several Federal Reserve presidents argued Thursday that surging Treasury yields reflect economic optimism for a solid recovery from the Covid-19 crisis and stressed that the central bank has no plans to tighten policy prematurely.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I think the rise in yields is probably a good sign so far because it does reflect better outlook for U.S. economic growth and inflation expectations which are closer to the committee’s inflation target,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told reporters after a virtual speech.  
&gt;  
&gt;Comments by Bullard and two other Fed leaders, Atlanta’s Raphael Bostic and Kansas City’s Esther George, showed that the central bank’s policy makers are solidly united behind Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s patience in making any adjustments to monetary policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Powell told lawmakers this week that the nation was still a “long way” from the Fed’s goals for full employment and price stability, signaling the central bank will maintain ultra-easy monetary policy for some time -- despite hopes for a strong economy later this year as vaccinations spread.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Fed presidents agreed with Powell’s characterization of the rise in yields as “a statement of confidence” in the economic outlook. The 10-year Treasury yield reached 1.61% Thursday, the highest in more than a year, before trimming its gains.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yields on U.S. 10-year notes have climbed to the highest in more than a year  
&gt;  
&gt;“Much of this increase likely reflects growing optimism in the strength of the recovery and could be viewed as an encouraging sign of increasing growth expectations,” George said in a speech.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bostic told reporters he was not expecting the Fed to respond to rising yields: “Yields have definitely moved at the longer end, but right now I am not worried about that.”  
&gt;  
&gt;All three Fed presidents said it was premature to begin discussing tapering of the central bank’s massive bond-buying program, with Bullard noting that Powell would initiate the discussion when it’s appropriate. Strong Rebound  
&gt;  
&gt;In separate remarks, a fourth Fed leader, New York’s John Williams, said the economy was poised for a strong rebound. “Indeed, with strong federal fiscal support and continued progress on vaccination, GDP growth this year could be the strongest we’ve seen in decades,” he said, though he added that underlying inflation is likely to remain “subdued for some time.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bullard echoed that optimism, noting the Atlanta Fed’s tracking model shows robust growth for gross domestic product in the first quarter. He predicted the U.S. unemployment rate will drop to 4.5% by year’s end, with pent-up demand and elevated savings boosting spending by Americans.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I gave a rosy outlook today but it’s only an outlook,” Bullard said. As for a policy change, “the chair has wanted to start that conversation only when it’s appropriate and not get ahead of ourselves even though we do have high hopes the pandemic will come to an end.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Bostic emphasized that the labor market still has considerable pain, especially for lower-income workers and minorities, and that it would take a long time to regain the 10 million jobs that have been lost.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Just to remind you, our mandate is full employment,” Bostic said Thursday during a virtual speech to the Atlanta Fed’s banking-outlook conference. “It’s not full GDP. It is not the size of GDP. So this disparity is something that is important and something we are going to have to continue to watch closely.”"|investing|Fed Views Rising Yields as Bullish Sign Reflecting 2021 Optimism|10.0|0.86

The risks comes primarily from ARK's illiquid and very large holdings in small cap companies. ARK is forced to sell its holdings whenever its liquid ETF gets hit with outflows as is especially the case in market downturns. This could force very painful liquidations at unfavorable prices and the ensuing crash goes into a positive feedback loop leading into a death spiral enticing even more outflows and predatory shorts.|investing|ARK ETFs implosion risk ------------------------|56.0|0.83

When I talked about futures with a value investor he was borderline scolding me for being a reckless gambler. Do you think I care? Hell, no. I manage a million dollar portfolio of growth stocks and I feel a strong sense of responsibility for protecting it. It's days like these when my beloved NQ comes to the rescue.

Futures contracts were precisely made for days like these. Airlines use futures contracts to reduce exposure to volatile fuel prices (it's called fuel hedging). Farmers do the same with commodities futures. You don't bastardize them by day trading those tiny ticks. You're just growing white hair from doing that! My goodness.

I wrote here a few days back and the post went completely ballistic. I proposed to invest with conviction and to understand what companies you're buying, otherwise to dump them. Know what you buy, and hold with conviction. I sincerely hope that the post helped many of you clean up your portfolios — just on time for this massive 3% drop today.

I'm not throwing my careful DD out of the window and fire sale all my holdings. I'm hanging in there with you guys and I'm here with another piece of advice. Learn the art of hedging. I hedged with the NQ on Feb 22 and am only down a fraction of a % today. Index futures were made for precisely this purpose because of their low margin. It would be near impossible to hedge an entire portfolio if you had to come up with an equal amount of cash. That's why hedging with ETFs (while possible) is highly inefficient.

Once a trend is established, it will remain intact for an extended period of time. If a trend reverses down like on Feb 22, you go short the entire portfolio value. You keep the hedge until the fog clears. Smaller portfolios (say 20k+) can be hedged with the new micro futures. They're 1/10th of the size of mini futures like the NQ.

Here's another advantage: as the trend resumes down, futures contracts settle in cash daily which means short positions will pile up fresh cash as the trend goes down. This cash is now at your disposal. You can pile into the stocks you believe in at near lows and you remove the hedge."|investing|Futures were made for days like these|6.0|0.62

For those who are unaware, liquidity premiums are relatively straightforward in theory. Basically liquidity premiums refers to additional returns earned above the market premium for holding securities that are illiquid. 

For an everyday of a liquid vs illiquid investment, consider stocks vs a house. Stocks are liquid because if I want to buy or sell a stock, I can do so rather instantaneous (and practically for free) on my phone or laptop. If I want to buy or sell a house, it is much more complicated, takes much longer, and costs a lot in transaction costs. 

Other examples of illiquid investments include: venture capital, collectors items and art, small businesses, hedge funds, private funds, vending machines, staking crypto, equipment, etc.

I'm curious as to people's thoughts on illiquid investments. Is the liquidity premium worth it? When? Why?"|investing|Let's talk about liquidity premiums|3.0|0.67

Again today there is a stock market sell-off but gold is also down more than 1%. Also with the big correction in feb 2020 gold also went down quite alot. Anybody can explain why this happens?

And no, this has nothing to do with money flowing from gold into bitcoin. The gold market is still x times bigger than bitcoin and when monday and tuesday the stock market and gold went down, so did bitcoin so that's not the reason.

One thing I read somewhere is that it might have to do with (leveraged) hedge funds getting more margin calls when equity markets go down and in order to post cash collateral they have to sell other assets like gold.

Not sure if that makes sense or is even the main reason so why is gold selling off, which is even more surpring since gold has also always functioned as inflation hedge.

Am I looking at this correctly?  Anyone else do the same?

If I’m able to sell cc’s that expire OTM each week, in my mind I’m recouping some of the potential loss and/or lowering my cost basis for higher profits when it takes off (which I still believe it will). I’m just hedging my bet that it will recover in the meantime with the cc. I have one expiring next week at 14.5 that I made a $0.13 premium on. If it finishes ITM, I lose money obviously, but if it gets close and still finishes OTM, I can turn it around and sell the next at slightly more money.

The first and only real estate company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: IIPR) focused on the regulated U.S. cannabis industry,[announced today results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2020](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/innovative-industrial-properties-q4-revenue-increases-110-to-37-1-million/), the fourth full year since IIP commenced real estate operations and completed its initial public offering in December 2016.

**Highlights**

- Generated total revenues of approximately $116.9 million, net income attributable to common stockholders of approximately $64.4 million and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) of approximately $97.8 million, representing increases of 162%, 191% and 180% over 2019, respectively.
- Recorded $3.27 of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share and $5.00 of adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) per diluted share, representing increases of 61% and 53% over 2019, respectively.
- Declared dividends to common stockholders totaling $4.47 per share, a 58% increase over 2019.
- Closed on over $620 million in new acquisitions and additional investments at existing properties (including commitments to fund future development/redevelopment, but excluding transaction costs), including 20 new property acquisitions, expanding IIP’s footprint to 66 properties totaling 5.4 million rentable square feet in 17 states at year-end.

&gt;*A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a corporation that combines the capital of many investors to acquire income producing real estate. As a public company traded on the NYSE, we are uniquely positioned in the industry to access public capital markets. As a REIT, one of our most attractive attributes is that we must distribute through a dividend to our stockholders at least 90 percent of our taxable income.[Innovative Industrial Properties has paid consecutive quarterly dividends to our common stockholders since the second quarter of 2017](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=IIPR).*

Imo, this is an excellent play for those who want exposure in the US Cannabis Industry without taking on too much risk. This company offers tremendous growth with impressive dividends.

IIPR partners with licensed operators across all products types: 
1) Cultivation
2) Processing
3) Distribution

The company owns approximately 70 properties located in 17 states totaling approximately 6million square feet 

...That’s alot of rent!

**Sale Leaseback Program**

Innovative Industrial Properties acquires freestanding industrial and retail properties from state-licensed medical-use cannabis operators. The properties are then leased back under long-term, absolute net lease agreements. They focus on well-capitalized companies that have successfully gone through the rigorous state licensing process and have been granted a license in the state where the property is located.

&gt;*We act as a source of capital to these state-licensed operators by acquiring and leasing back their real estate. This allows for the opportunity to redeploy the proceeds into core operations, yielding a higher return than they would otherwise get from owning real estate.*

EXAMPLE:
- Targeted deal size - $5 million to $30+ million
- Additional expansion capital available
- Lease term – 10 to 20 years
- Initial base rent – 10% to 16% on total investment (based on property underwriting)
- Annual base rent escalations – 3% to 4.5%
- Security deposit and corporate guaranty based on credit underwriting
- Transaction timeline – closing 30 to 60 days from signed purchase and sale agreement

We thank the IIP team for moving quickly to address our real estate capital needs with a solution that works well for us, and we look forward to completing the significant expansion of our production capacity at the property to address the tremendous demand of patients and consumers of Illinois.” (Mitchell Kahn - CEO/Founder of Grassroots)

**Conclusion**

IIPR provides a ripe opportunity to invest in the cannabis industry while providing growth/dividends, *HOWEVER*, I personally think it is a bit overbought(98%). Closed right around ATH today of 222.082usd.

I am looking to swing trade here &amp; enter below 200usd with additional support around 180. (Anything under 200 is a buy imo) ...Buystops placed @ 225usd in case of bullish continuation. I plan to re-evaluate late dated calls if/when premiums start to drop.

I strongly encourage everyone to do their own DD and deepdive the management here, as I am not a Financial Advisor. Imo, IIPR is poised for significant growth.

However as a start thinking about retiring one day I’d like to be a little more conservative keep my principal and invest in something that pays dividends. So I started to do a little bit of due diligence, full disclosure I have about 20+ years till retirement. So what I was looking into is ones that pay dividends, I ran across $GOF.  It’s about $20/share and pays monthly dividends of $0.182.  

My question is: if you invest $1MM in GOF you’ll have 50,000 share and generate $9,100 (50,000 x 0.182) per month.  The price is stable and expense ratio is low.  Is this correct?

With my S&amp;P 500 investments and my tenure till retirement, I can expect liberally a 10% per year return. And the way I’m investing, I could assume (hypothetical) $5MM by the time I retire.

I am, \[30M\] Engineer form the UK looking to DIY my pension. After losing yet another job to redundancy my employer pension is stalled yet again.

Ive got some Ideas of what I want to do from buying investing books and listening to freaknomics and econtalk.

I have put $2K into a SIPP with ii.com . They charge $10 a month flat fee, that sounded good for longer term when I have hopefully a large amount invested and still spending $120py.

I aim to add $2K per year until retirement. 

My issue was the first EFT pick (I went for EFT as the built in spread and dividend payout plus tiny fees sounded awesome)  


I bought $2K of XMAF which tracks top 50 African companies. This appealed to me as a great long term investment as the continent has barely started its industrial revolution and is taking a lot of investment from china for infrastructure to reach its huge natural resources.  


I believe this is a non dividend EFT, it also looks very flat and stuck hovering around $8 the past 5 years.

My second choice was VOO but unfortunately we are not allowed to trade that in the UK due to regulations involving KIDD.

\[I should also mention I bought 1K of bit coin and sold it for 3K, and a 1K bar of actual gold, and when I went to sell it the post office lost it, so I am the type of investor with the expirence that bitcoin is a safer bet then gold\]

1614200052.0|0.0|t3_lrn8jl|12.0|"Hi all, first post here. Wanted to get some feedback on my investment analysis on $MIC or Macquarie Infrastructure Corp. The 5 minute version is that this is a holding company in process of liquidating, with two remaining assets. 90% of the value is in Atlantic Aviation, which owns and operates private jet terminals at 70 airports. The rest is in Hawaii Gas, which is a gas distribution business in Hawaii. 

This is a very short term as the company expects to sell both assets by year end, so the upside in the trade is rather limited - I think the value of the companies is going to be ~$37/share vs. currently at $32/share. However, by using options, we can apply artificial leverage to the trade and increase the potential gain.

When you think about those private jet terminals, they are effectively parking lots located at major airports. There isn't much room to add more, and the average lease life on them is 22 years. So as private jet traffic increases, this company is positioned to increase prices significantly. This is why their nearest competitor was acquired for 16x pre-Covid EBITDA in a protracted bidding war just last month. It's a fragmented market with a lot of room to roll up small mom and pop operators and realize synergies. Historical EBITDA growth of 6%/year exceeded GDP growth by 2-3x, so it's a great asset for infrastructure funds.

The risks in this trade is that there isn't really a reason for a buyer to pay much above the current market price if there isn't competition. So the trade only works if there is a competitive bidding auction for the airport business and the asset trades for 15-16x pre-Covid EBITDA.

It's also interesting that in the comparable sale the buyer included Bill Gates, a guy who knows a thing or two about Covid and vaccine rollout. He bought the shares in the public market before and used the sale to increase his ownership. I think people in general didn't want to bid against Bill Gates and two PE sponsors (who is going to outbid three giant buyers splitting the asset?), so the price it sold might actually be even higher than 16x.

&gt; October 18 (Renewables Now) - GE Renewable Energy has installed the prototype of its 12-MW Haliade-X offshore wind turbine at the port of Rotterdam, the General Electric (NYSE:GE) unit said on Thursday.

### Very Electric

&gt; According to the manufacturer, a 12-MW turbine can generate 67 GWh annually, or enough electricity for about 16,000 European homes, and avoid up to 42 million ~~tonnes~~ **kg** of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions(edited to reflect error pointed out in comments). The first orders for the new machine have already been placed, coming from SSE Renewables and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) for the Dogger Bank offshore complex in the North Sea. Also, Denmark’s Ørsted A/S (CPH:ORSTED) has selected the Haliade-X turbine for the 120-MW Skipjack project off Maryland and the 1.1-GW Ocean Wind complex off New Jersey.

Summary (below): https://perspectives.dtcc.com/articles/leading-the-industry-to-accelerated-settlement  

-

**Q: What are the industry benefits of accelerated settlement?**

A: Time to settlement equals counterparty risk, and margin requirements, which are designed to mitigate those risks, represent cost to members. The immediate benefits of moving to a T+1 settlement cycle could mean cost savings, reduced market risk and lower margin requirements.

Today an average of over $13.4 billion is held in margin every day to manage counterparty default risk in the system. Shortening the settlement cycle would help strike a balance between risk-based margining and reducing procyclical impacts.

In one significant finding in the paper, our risk model simulations have shown that the Volatility component of NSCC’s margin could potentially be reduced by 41% by moving to T+1, assuming current processing and without any other changes in client or market behavior.

https://perspectives.dtcc.com/assets/img/aaapicture1.png  


**Q: What is multilateral netting and why is it so beneficial?**

A: One of NSCC’s primary roles in the industry is netting — the automatic process of offsetting a firm’s buy orders for a particular security against its sell orders for that security. Netting consolidates the amounts due from and owed to a firm across all the different securities it has traded to a single net debit or a net credit.

Allowing trades to “net” settle reduces the total amount of cash and securities that have to go back and forth throughout the day, and eliminates a significant amount of operational and market risk. By netting down or reducing the total number of customer trading obligations that require the exchange of money for settlement, NSCC helps to minimize risk and free up trillions of dollars of capital each year. Every day, NSCC netting reduces the value of payments that need to be exchanged by an average of 98-99%.

**Q: Why stop at T+1 or T+½? Why not go to real-time settlement?**

A: Real-time settlement is a simple technical solution but a very complicated market structure change. While the industry should continue to aspire to real-time, it is more pragmatic to reduce the settlement cycle in stages to capture the benefits faster. With real-time settlement in today’s market structure, the entire industry – clients, brokers, investors – loses the liquidity and risk-mitigating benefit of netting, and that is particularly critical during times of heightened volatility and volume. For example, on a typical trading day, NSCC processes an average of about $1.7 trillion in equities transactions. The multilateral netting process reduces that number by about 98%, and the total value settled is around $38 billion. Netting allows brokerages to transfer that $38 billion between parties only once at the end of the day. In a real-time settlement scenario, netting is not possible and trillions of dollars in cash and securities must move through the financial system on a continual basis throughout the trading day. This creates massive market and capital inefficiencies, increases credit and operational risks, and increases costs between trading parties, possibly undermining the stability of the markets.

Accelerating settlement requires careful consideration, industry coordination, and a balanced approach so settlement can be achieved as close to the trade as possible (for example, T+1 or T+½), without creating capital inefficiencies and introducing new, unintended market risks, such as eliminating the enormous benefits and cost savings of multilateral netting.

**Q: What needs to be accomplished to accelerate the industry’s settlement cycle to T+1 and beyond?**

A: DTCC is prepared to move quickly to lead the industry to accelerate the settlement cycle to T+1 and beyond. NSCC and DTC already support T+1 and even some same-day settlement using existing technology, though many market participants do not use this option due to market structure complexities, legacy business and operational processes. Many don’t realize, DTC has always been a T+0 settlement platform ever since its inception in 1973 -- even when the industry settled at T+5, T+3 and now T+2.

As we describe in the paper, in our discussions with the industry, many firms appear ready to start revising their processes to accelerate settlement. They realize it’s in their best interest: shortened settlement times reduce market risk and margin requirements, which would allow firms to use those resources in other ways.

Equity clearing and settlement is part of a much larger ecosystem of linked financial markets. Accelerating the settlement cycle would have upstream and downstream impacts on other parts of the market structure, including derivatives, securities lending, cash borrowing, foreign exchange and collateral processing, and developing a new accelerated settlement system could fundamentally change current market structure. In order to move to T+1, industry participants must align and implement the necessary operational and business changes, and regulators must be engaged"|investing|DTCC outlines a two-year industry roadmap for T+1 settlement of US equities|10.0|0.73

Here are some of my thoughts from being an active member since 2007. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have about the platform.

Roblox has been available to the public since 2006; you’re not investing in a new up &amp; coming company. It’s been around for 16 years, which is very long for an online game. That in itself is a good sign, but its potential and success is pretty cemented as of now. The lack of worldwide reach (with the majority of users being from North America) is worrisome, but there may be room for growth.

They are currently sitting at **2.4 billion** registered users. The daily active user (DAU) count is somewhere around **30 million** (see S-1 form in my edit).  Thus, the vast majority of registered users are inactive users or bots who prey on dumb kids to steal their account info via cookies. This is more of an anecdote than something you can really back up with hard numbers and data because it’s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for “free Robux” and such. There’s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it’s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter &amp; number usernames. Their security and captcha, to summarize, sucks.

Roblox itself is a game client, but the website houses a variety of games made by users, of varying quality. There are some real gems but some real garbage as well. The front page cycles the same popular games and not a lot of up-and-coming ones. I can imagine it would be quite difficult to break into the algorithm if you’re not already a popular developer. Some people use/pay for bots to pump up their game’s likes and user count. This is obviously against the site's TOS, but it’s difficult to get ahead unless you pour hundreds into on-site ads.

Years ago, they shut down the forum, which contributed to a lot of helpful and insightful on-site discussion. They did so because they believed it was becoming difficult to moderate. Hire more moderators? That on top of the fact that the chat filter (both on-site and in-game) is becoming increasingly overbearing, it’s difficult to hold a conversation on the website, let alone form a tight-knit community. I feel a community is **essential** to the success of a social game platform like this one; right now, it feels like a soulless, barren corporate wasteland, compared to what it was before. Take a look at their [logo change](https://logos-world.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Roblox-Logo-History.jpg), which summarizes the company’s new ethos well. There’s the argument that the chat filter needs to be overbearing because of the possibility of online predators - which is true - but there’s a difference between overbearing and broken. Sometimes, every second word is censored, even completely innocent ones.

Their customer support is pretty dismal. Not much else to say here, but I’ve personally dealt with it, and unless you are asking something really basic that can be answered by looking at the FAQ, they’re not much help. Just your typical outsourced copy &amp; paste replies. When it comes to accidental moderation resulting in bans or account deletion, or account theft, they’re not very helpful. I’ve had an account made in 2010 deleted in 2016 for something I did not do (account theft; the account itself was stolen) and they were no help.

Years ago as well, the “free” currency Tickets were removed, leaving the premium one, Robux. Tickets were awarded on daily login and could be used to purchase cosmetics and such. Now, join any game and almost every avatar you see is the default one because the vast majority of kids aren’t paying for the premium membership which gives you monthly Robux, nor are they paying for Robux itself.

Thus, parent’s wallets are the limiting factor on how much Roblox can grow, because a lot of the older base such as myself shares the same sour sentiment regarding the website as a whole. Even newer users are seen calling for the “glory days” of Roblox to come back, which is odd since they themselves did not experience those “glory days”. That being said, the general community sentiment seems that not many people are happy with the site in its current state, which makes me wonder if it’s current young user base is sustainable or if Roblox depends on cycling generations of kids and isn’t really capable of building an older following in its current state.

Moving on, there’s a thriving black market for Robux and limited cosmetic items because of the aforementioned poor on-site economy. The cosmetics catalog used to have sales for holidays like Black Friday and Memorial Day. These are no longer a thing as of the last few years, which seems like a simple enough thing to do to keep Robux flowing in the economy, but they refuse to do so. (??)

Speaking of site-wide events, celebrations like a yearly Egg Hunt, events which were dear to many users, are no more. Instead, they are replaced with corporate promotional events. These don’t yield independent games made by Roblox themselves like the Egg Hunt; instead, independent developers are “contracted” to shimmy these elements into their games. Doesn’t make for a very memorable experience, and I don’t know if the microtransactions yielded are any higher than they were for the previous events.

The search function on the website is pretty broken; for example, if you search the cosmetics catalog for “Adidas hoodie”, that can net you “ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS ADIDAS” named items that may not be a hoodie or relevant to what you’re looking for at all, just something that’s spammed the tag you searched for. This has been the case for years and no attempt to remedy it is evident.

Recently, user-generated content (UGC) has been introduced to the cosmetics catalog, in which approved users can upload hats and other cosmetics rather than just Roblox themselves as before. One of the only good features introduced in the last few years in my opinion, but as a result, Roblox itself has essentially stopped making any cosmetics themselves.

Basically, with the content creation almost exclusively done by independent users and developers, the site now runs itself. As a result, it feels the platform has been stagnating creatively for years. Beyond updating the game client, it’s not really clear what (if anything) Roblox does behind the scenes to promote growth. There’s a lot of very simple improvements and features that could be introduced to satisfy the user base and maintain the appeal to kids and the older audience, but Roblox seems to be reluctant to do so for some reason. For instance, it’s weird that users are begging for on-site sales, which are such a cornerstone of almost any business, or site events, which should be essential as a social game platform. This makes me worry they are forgetting that their user base made them successful in the first place. In short, it doesn’t seem to have the exponential growth it saw from 2007 to the early/mid-2010s, which is worrisome as the platform as a whole is not doing a good job at creating a loyal user base.

All that being said, this is my perspective of a player. I hope a developer can chime in with their thoughts on the pros and cons of developing on Roblox, what their Robux income looks like, and how that translates into real-world currency.

**EDIT:** This post has blown up way past the point I expected it to. As such, I feel it's necessary to address some of the points that myself and others have brought up in this thread. Going forward, this will be more of a financial approach that can tie in with my product/customer analysis.

[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:

&gt;***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  
&gt;  
&gt;We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2 million, $86.0 million, and $203.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0 million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.

Roblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:

&gt;***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  
&gt;  
&gt;We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June 30, 2020, September 30, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March 31, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September 30, 2019 to the nine months ended September 30, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  
&gt;  
&gt;• **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  
&gt;  
&gt;• **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  
&gt;  
&gt;**• increase global awareness of our brand.**

The bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:

&gt;***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  
&gt;  
&gt;Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.

Largely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.

So, let's conclude. Where do we stand?

* [Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/vzbeykpuffj61.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb544d5496049a3bd14bce8db3cad31e1896db6a)
   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?
   * This is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)
* [Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.](https://www.amazon.com/roblox?=&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=r05d13-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=5562fc29c05b45562a86358c198356eb&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;productGridPageIndex=2)
* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.
   * For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2 million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8 million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.
      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.

So, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.

**EDIT 2**: I feel the need to address a point brought up in [this comment chain, which is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine &amp; platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.

For Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of ""kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative"", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.

The game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. [Here are some images showing what's possible.](https://preview.redd.it/s5b0bxgqkfj61.png?width=690&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1447a41923c6ec69d9626a644d486c54c3af78) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:

&gt;68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

These kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:

&gt;For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.

A lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns. Furthermore, the most popular games are cash grab ""simulators"" and carbon copies of games that already exist, sometimes with stolen assets. That presents a copyright problem if Roblox is to continue expanding.

If you got this far, thanks for reading, and best of luck in your future investments."|investing|Thoughts from my personal experience with Roblox over the past 15 years|1505.0|0.95

The companies/stocks i’m getting at are the tobacco giants. I own stock in the four major tobacco companies. And have for quite some time now. Low valuations and humongous dividends? What more could you ask for? 

These companies don’t get much love simply because they’re regarded as “sin stocks” which is fair I suppose, but there seems to be opportunity. 


Despite that, a lot of people are bracing for cannabis reforms which will unlock a new market. At least further advance it. No one really talks about the effect it will have on tobacco companies. This would drive their growth incredibly. You’d have to imagine if cannabis became legal in the US and available for retail sale, these guys would dive in head first. They have cash and infrastructure already at their disposal. Most, if not all, already have part ownership or at least partnerships going on. 

I think cannabis companies are great potential investments themselves, but no one points out tobacco companies much. It seems like they’ll be some of the biggest beneficiaries of policies like that. And less risky at that."|investing|Good sector/stocks no one seems to talk about lately.|41.0|0.76

The supply from mining is tiny at 6 million ounces per year (gold is 110 million ounces per year in comparison) and demand is projected to be over 10 million ounces for this year. And that is ignoring what appears to be a large surge in non-industrial investment demand in recent weeks for both palladium and its ""twin sister"" platinum. If this non-industrial investment demand continues, supply may dry up in literally weeks.

GM recently announced it’s targeting a full lineup of zero emission vehicles by 2035 and 30 EVs by 2030. Here’s what we know for sure is coming:

* They already have the Chevy Bolt which, though it has less sex appeal than a Tesla, is widely considered a solid technical competitor to the Model 3. It’s scheduled for some facelifts and range upgrades.
* The Hummer EV is, I would argue, the single most desirable EV scheduled for imminent production. The specs are insane and it looks beautiful inside and out. Pricing will obviously keep average buyers out, but it’s a tremendous halo car and reservations for the top trim level were claimed almost immediately after they went up.
* The Cadillac Lyriq has lovely styling, the interior looks incredible (but so far is only renders), and is rumored to start under $60k, which starts to bring it into more mainstream purchasing territory

Assuming GM can execute on these, those are three fabulous early entries to the EV market which indicate to me that GM wants to put some truly desirable vehicles out there. [There are plenty more entries on the way that we haven’t seen.](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33352012/gm-electric-cars-cadillac-chevy-buick-hummer-specs/) On top of these individual cars, I think GM has some solid competitive edges:

* They’re an established auto maker that makes quality vehicles under trusted brands. Teslas still suffer from build quality issues and I expect some level of consumer apprehension when it comes to buying EVs from other new companies
* They’re targeting dramatically less expensive battery packs that will be 40% less expensive than what they use in the Bolt and are projecting 60% less expensive for gen 2
* They’re targeting a 450 mile range for some vehicles (I’d guess sedans competing with the Model S)
* Their Super Cruise autonomous driving tech (currently exclusive to Cadillac) is [arguably superior to Tesla’s](https://youtu.be/AhthZ5rxQJs) and will be on 22 vehicles in two years - I’d expect they want to get this in as many of their EVs as they can

What I’m seeing here is a proven auto maker setting up a very solid foundation to capture the EV/AV market. While Tesla and Rivian and Nio capture a lot of press and investor capital, there is absolutely no guarantee that any one of them turns out to be more than a side player in the long term. Am I crazy to think GM could be the real EV winner? If so, their stock looks mighty cheap at the moment."|investing|GM as the future king of EVs|0.0|0.35

\- the SAFE act for MSOs to get access to banking  

\- uplisting to NYSE (US MSOs are currently traded as OTC leaving the vast majority of institutional investors on the outside looking in for now)

\- more states legalizing independently 

Decriminalization even without full legalization would be a major boon for growth but is not even necessary for growth to continue with more states legalizing and/or relaxing restrictions on MSOs. The 4 major players (Green Thumb, Cresco, Trulieve, and Curaleaf) are all on top in this. They maintained solid financials, limited debt/losses, huge expansion across all medical/recreational states and are almost certainly going to remain the big 4 post-legalization. A play across these 4 covers the majority of gains we'll see leading up to and after legalization.

&gt;Transaction values Parallel at an implied enterprise value of US$1.884 billion

&gt;Investors commit to an over-subscribed US$225 million private placement at closing; combined public company expected to have US$430 million cash balance at closing

*""We believe Parallel is ideally positioned for its next phase of growth, as we continue to build our presence in strategic markets and invest in innovation, R&amp;D and the customer experience. Today's milestone announcement is a testament to Parallel's impressive growth to date, the strength of our business fundamentals, strong balance sheet, and above all, our unwavering commitment to further developing and enhancing our portfolio of cannabinoid products.”*

*This transaction will enable Parallel to accelerate existing investments to transform not only our company but also the cannabis industry, as we seek to disrupt the more traditional beverage alcohol and healthcare spaces. We look forward to working with the Ceres team and benefiting from Scooter Braun's expertise and extensive influencer network to reach our diverse consumers with creative omnichannel approaches that will fuel Parallel's leadership in the cannabis industry.*

[Ceres Acquisition Corp](http://www.ceresacquisition.com/) ($CERAF)

a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) co-founded by Scott “Scooter” Braun – will buy Parallel, allowing the new company to go public by taking on Ceres’ listing on Canada’s NEO Exchange.

&gt;A group of investors, led by existing Ceres and Parallel investors, have committed to the deal through an oversubscribed private investment in public equity (PIPE) of $225 million at a price of $10 per share at closing, according to a news release.

Other investors include institutions and private family offices in the United States and Canada.

Ceres' deep cannabis and consumer experience, coupled with Scooter's powerful network, makes Ceres an ideal partner for a well-positioned, well-led, high growth cannabis company like Parallel.

[Parallel](https://www.liveparallel.com/)

Parallel is the latest large marijuana business to go public. Parallel changed its corporate name from Surterra Wellness in 2019 but still uses the Surterra brand in Florida and Texas.

Wrigley will continue to serve as Parallel’s chair and CEO, while Braun – who has managed notable acts such as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande – will serve as a special advisor.

&gt;The deal is expected to close this summer.

It must be approved by shareholders of both companies, U.S. and Canadian regulators as well as the NEO Exchange and over-the-counter markets, where Ceres currently trades as CERE and CERAF, respectively.

Parallel has 42 dispensaries in five states –-Florida, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Nevada and Texas – and forecasts $447 million in 2021 net revenue, according to the release.

Parallel also announced that it intends to enter into a partnership with [Cookies](https://cookies.co/), a cannabis company from California’s Bay Area that has established itself as a recognizable flower brand in several states.

The release said the collaboration – subject to the approval of the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board – will strengthen Parallel’s presence in Las Vegas.

TL;DR LPL Financial is an independent broker dealer (BD) that is growing quickly through both M&amp;A and Organic means. I see them as a value play with good growth potential as they continue to expand and enhance their business model. Their management has done well to capitalize on their favorable position in their space and they now are looking to bolster their operational capacity to create a scalable framework through innovation.

Overview: LPL Financial is the largest independent BD in the U.S. and has been growing rapidly the past few years through organic means and acquisitions. As an independent BD they do not create or sell their own products and only last year did they add an employee model. They have a very balanced business model and a strong balance sheet and are continually looking for opportunities in which to use their cash. In the past few years they have continually beat earnings estimates with new records for growth and revenue. Increasingly they have been gaining new advisors that are dropping from larger names like Schwab and Raymond James in favor of their independent platform.  

Growth: LPL is focused on delivering quality service and support to their advisors and has been working to brand itself as one of the big players in the space. As part of customer service focus, LPL has also stepped into the fintech space, acquiring a few companies recently to add their services as free tools for their advisors to help in managing their client’s portfolios. In 2020 LPL jumped into the employee model, adding advisors as employees from some related banks and additionally acquired Allen and Co. to further expand the platform. While the employee model hasn’t been a large focus, it gives advisors more options to join without the need to open their own branch. I’d expect that they’ll continue to push for growth in all business streams and focus on the best ways to allocate their capital while also looking to secure larger lines of credit at current favorable rates.

Value: LPL has a very balanced business with strong financials and makes money regardless of whether the market is up or down. They have secured favorable consistent revenue streams through their insured cash account (ICA) and deposit cash account (DCA) programs in which they’ll earn revenue when a client is holding cash. LPL still operates with a commission model which secures more revenue and they continue to quickly expanding their advisory platform. I’d expect that as growth continues, LPL will continue to manage their expenses and likely look to restructure or refinance their debt at these lower rates as well as look to maximize revenue from their sweep programs through more favorable contracts.

Potential Concerns:

1.       Growing too fast – many companies within this space are generally inundated with old technology and archaic processes built around regulatory policy. With the large influx of advisors, their operations can be overwhelmed and cause an exodus to another firm if they cannot keep up with the growth.

a.       Counterpoint – their “advisors come first” business model will force them to combat any scalability issues head on and as they look to grow more they will continue to improve their infrastructure.

2.       Operational inefficiencies – similar to the discussion point above, LPL’s operations are in question with outdated technology and whether or not they can keep up with a fast-growing fintech space.

a.       Counterpoint – I believe LPL has opportunity to outperform others in this sector and continue to grow its market share as advisors move to a more nimble and modern company. LPL also has the capacity to expand their back office operations to compensate for the influx of advisors as they continue improve their systems. They have also shown they are willing to buy technology if needed and they have added an Austin, TX campus for the purpose of expanding their technology workforce.

3.       Outdated business model – With commission free trading at some brokers, an emphasis on retail and an exploding fintech space, the advisor model seems outdated when you can manage a portfolio yourself without a fee.

a.       Counterpoint – although there is a large focus on retail and self-ran portfolios, there is still a place for advisors as older generations look to retire and younger ones get into their prime earning years and do not have the time nor confidence to manage a portfolio. Also, there will undoubtedly be some Gen-Ys &amp; Gen-Zs out there that will get burned from volatility and frightened off even more then they have been in the past.

Final Thoughts: LPL is currently trading in the lower range of their target and looks to have good support at the $130.00 level. LPL is getting more attention from analysts and has increased the number of analysts reviewing the company by 50% in the past few years. LPL generally experiences stable growth with short boom cycles post earnings, which is due to the low volume as it is primarily held by institutions. In 2016 there was a large drop in the share price as one institution reduced its holdings. Since then the stock has experienced solid growth until the 2020 crash but has rebounded and surpassed its early 2020 ATH levels. Although its $0.25 quarterly dividend is a low yield, I believe the main focus should be in its growth (but the extra bit of cash quarterly is nothing to scoff at). As we’ve seen in the past few months, growth has accelerated in the financial sector and I believe it will continue as investors look for value and as firms take advantage of the liquidity in markets to set themselves up for the future. "|investing|DD on $LPLA|18.0|0.77

2000 can't ever happen again, it's not 1999, but it's a near certainty that growth funds and stocks will undergo some kind of significant correction and small/mid cap value will take over again. Eventually. Right? So with that said...

What other things might cause a growth fund bubble burst and do we have any kind of ability to foresee them? My understanding is that after economic hardship, small cap value stocks lead the way in market recovery - but does the covid market count as economic hardship? If so, why did growth funds beat the pants off of value funds during and after the 2020 crash?

How does an intelligent investor (definitely not me) even begin to attempt to foresee (or even react swiftly to) such a shift?

My retirement is about 60% mid and large cap growth and 40% mid and small cap value. I'm young enough to ride out swings for about 15 years and then I have to start being more careful. If I'm being honest, diversification is hard for me, my instinct is to chase past returns. part of me says it's time to rebalance entirely into growth and then hope I find a crystal ball...

&gt;In a dramatic response to a federal inquiry,
Infinity Q Capital Management
announced Monday it’s shutting a $1.8 billion mutual fund and that it placed Velissaris on leave, cutting off his access to accounts and trading while hiring an expert to value holdings. The firm said it had learned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether Velissaris, now 36, incorrectly valued complex derivatives.


&gt;The SEC told Infinity Q’s non-executive chairman that the agency’s investigators had obtained evidence Velissaris adjusted models used to price swap contracts held by the
Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund
, likely resulting in incorrect valuations being reported to investors, according to a company statement on Monday.


&gt;“Infinity Q has independently verified that Mr. Velissaris did access and alter the third party’s valuation models but has not yet assessed the impact of those alterations,” the company said. Its website, which says the firm uses a “quantamental” strategy blending quantitative research with a private equity discipline, was in “maintenance mode” on Monday night.

&gt;In an emailed statement, Velissaris’s attorneys, Sean Hecker and Michael Ferrara, said: “Our client has acted in good faith throughout his tenure at Infinity Q and will continue to do so moving forward. His focus has always been on delivering and preserving value for investors.”

/

&gt;Infinity Q was using models provided by an outside pricing service to determine the value of the swap contracts, according to the request filed with the SEC for permission to suspend redemptions. Based on information provided by the SEC, Infinity Q found out last week that the firm’s CIO had been “adjusting certain parameters” within the models that affected the valuation of the swaps, the firm said in a filing.


&gt;The Diversified Value Fund held swap contracts with a fair value of $449 million at the end of November, equaling about 26% of its $1.71 billion in net assets at the time, according to its most recent portfolio report to the SEC. This included so-called variance swap contracts written by a wide range of Wall Street banks that were tied to the volatility of global market benchmarks, such as the S&amp;P 500 index.


&gt;Leonard Potter, Infinity Q’s non-executive chairman, will take over management of the firm. Potter is the owner of Wildcat Capital Management, which managed more than $3 billion at the end of 2019, including capital from Bonderman.


&gt;The Diversified Alpha Fund’s institutional shares have gained almost 1% year-to-date, performance that ranked below almost 90% of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

[**Investment Firm Halts Redemptions on $1.8 Billion
Fund**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investment-firm-halts-redemptions-on-1-8-billion-fund-11614090454#:~:text=Investment%20firm%20Infinity%20Q%20Capital,issues%20valuing%20the%20fund's%20holdings.)

&gt;Investment firm Infinity Q Capital Management LLC asked the Securities and Exchange
Commission to halt redemptions on a $1.8 billion fund and is looking to liquidate its
holdings.


&gt;The request comes after the firm was unable to value some of its holdings, which include
swaps, in one of its funds. Infinity Q had about $3 billion in assets under management at
the end of January, with roughly $1.8 billion belonging to its Infinity Q Diversified Alpha
Fund, according to an SEC filing. The fund employed strategies across several markets,
including derivatives, stocks, and futures, according to FactSet.

&gt;Halting redemptions is an unusual move, since mutual funds offer freedom to cash out at
any time, and it suggests severe problems at the firm. Third Avenue Management LLC
halted redemptions in one of its credit funds in 2015, a move that shocked the market, left
a black mark on the firm and spurred worries about the wider bond market.


&gt;The SEC informed Infinity Q’s non-executive chairman, Len Potter, that staff had evidence
that the firm’s Chief Investment Officer James Velissaris “had been adjusting parameters”
of pricing models that were used to value derivatives in the fund’s portfolio, according to
a spokesman for Infinity Q. As a result, incorrect valuations were likely being reported to
investors. The spokesman said in a statement that the firm is “cooperating with the SEC
investigation” and has cut off Mr. Velissaris’s access to trading.


ruh roh...

Pour one out for mah liquid alts homies.

e: Looks like the ""mispriced"" swaps were around 17-20% of the portfolio, and the word I'm hearing is that the company (Infinity Q) is treating this basically like it's deliberate fraud.  So this is a pretty wild thing to happen in the mutual fund world.  It looks like there was some potentially systemic overvaluation with regard to their swaps in order to make performance look better than it was.  I realize most people aren't super familiar with this stuff but 40 act funds are super regulated, this sort of thing just does not happen much at all.  

realistically this should serve as a bit of a cautionary tale to anyone who's interested in looking in to the alts space, or anything that has some investments that aren't publicly listed and able to easily be marked to market."|investing|Infinity Q is having a pretty garbage day today|46.0|0.84

Price / Sales ratio. The higher the number, the more expensive the stock is compared to sales.

**What about P/E ratio?** 

Price / Earnings ratio is great for mature companies, but the hottest stocks typically lose money, so P/S is a quick and lazy proxy.

**Got an example?** 

Take AAPL's Market Cap of $2113B and TTM sales of $294B. 2113/294=7. So the P/S ratio of AAPL is 7. Is that good or bad? Well it depends on the industry. Typically Apple has a PS ratio of 2-5. APPL had a PS ratio of 7 at the end of 2007, and we all know what happened in 2008, right?

**What does the P/S ratio have to do with anything?**

There are currently [54 stocks with a PS over 30](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps&amp;r=41).

The stocks with the highest P/S ratio [are getting hit the hardest](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;f=cap_largeover,fa_ps_o10&amp;o=-ps).

**Is having a PS ratio over 30 bad?** 

Historically, anything with a P/S over 30 underperforms as an investment. The revenue growth will outperform, but the overall stock still underperforms, because all that revenue growth was already priced in.  None of the FANG stocks ever exceeded a P/S ratio of 25. MSFT had a PS ratio of about 28 back in 1999, and it took 17 years for the price to recover. 

**When was the last time we had this many stocks with a P/S over 30?** 

At the end of 1999 we had 22, making up 6.70% of US market cap. From 2001-2019 we had very few. At the end of 2020 we had 50, making up 4.80% of US market cap. 

**How significant is this?** 

I don't know, man. 5% of the market is not significant. Also, there isn't a lot of data, only 31 stocks went over a P/S ratio of 30 from 2001-2019 (the other 85 instances occurred in 2000 &amp; 2020.)  Also it's worth noting the valuation of all stocks [has been trending up](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price-to-sales) because of low rates. Yay?

**What should you do?** 

I don't know, man. I am not a broker/ dealer. This is not advice. You can quickly check your individual stocks P/S ratio on [finviz](https://finviz.com/). P/S over 10 is red, which means you should dig deeper.

**Edit:** No I am not implying Apple caused the housing bubble to pop in 2008. Let me be specific. From 2007 to 2008 Apples revenue went up (24b to 32b), earnings went up (3.4b-4.8b), but its stock fell (180-85).

I have long been told that rates will move inverse to bond prices (obviously true), and that an increase in price in some asset is typically caused by an increase in demand for that asset.

So, I am confused why, as rates have increased (bond prices down) we have seen stocks come under so much pressure.

If rates are increasing without announcements from the FED, should we not assume that it’s because there is reduced demand for bonds (and therefore increases demand for stocks)??

Or, have people as a whole just decided bonds are worth less without actually seeing significant changes in the volume of demand?

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at $6B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 749.5M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 6-8B.
* Alexander Tamas is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* Tamas previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and Mail.ru. His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to “self-deal” which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* Tamas has over 140M of his own dollars invested in VYGG common shares. This incentivises him to only partner with a strong business that can truly grow over an extended period of time.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of billions someday.
* Steve Huffman’s goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other “authentically”.
* Reddit had job openings for their IPO readiness team until Febuary 9th, 2021. They filled their last position which was the leader of the IPO readiness team. This means their entire IPO team is now complete and working on putting their IPO deal together.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.
* On Febuary 8th, 2021, Vy Capital led a 250M round on Reddit which can be considered a pre-IPO round. This round gives it’s current investors the ability to go to their clients and show them good returns. It also boosts the valuation so when Reddit goes public it doesn’t do a 3x on valuation from 3B to 8-10B, but from 6B to 8-10B. - Much easier to sell to the public investors.
* This funding round also gave its current shareholders the opportunity to buy more of its shares right before it goes public.
* The money raised is going to be put towards attracting advertisers and brands, building its workforce by doubling its staff, and expanding internationally. This can be considered a story round where Reddit is projecting a future as a multi-billion dollar advertising social media business. Exactly the type of business that gets crazy price/sales multiples in the current market environment.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

* Alexander Tamas - CEO at Vy Capital, Chairman at Vy Global Growth - Social media and internet business expert. Just led a 250M fundraising round on Reddit.
* John Hering - CEO at VYGG - Cyber security expert. Lots of experience scaling online platforms to millions of users. Strong aversion to the misuse of data. Fits with Reddits values.
* Hugo Barra - Board Member at VYGG - Experience with expanding technology companies userbase internationally (Xiaomi). VP of VR at Facebook. Scaled Android OS to more than a billion users. Fits with social media narrative.
* Justin Kan - VYGG Board Member - Founder of Twitch.tv. Social media expert. Scaled Twitch.tv to more than 200 million users. Has been friends with Steve Huffman for over 15 years. Was in the first Y-combinator round along with Steve Huffman. Would be a useful Board Member for Reddit.
* Steve Huffman - Founder &amp; CEO of Reddit - Is putting the pieces in place for a Reddit IPO (probably through the SPAC process). Finished putting Reddit’s IPO readiness team together on Febuary, 9th 2021.

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $10.01 of cash is in the trust per common share.
2. Medium case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share.
3. Best case: I’m right and VYGG merges with Reddit. The market is still very expensive due to mass hysteria and low interest rates. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly punching up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 6-8B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months).

**Valuation Model**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 58B, Pinterest - 52B, Snapchat - 98B.

I realized that most of my stocks are in some way related to tech (software, hardware, car manufacturers,...). So I’m looking into industries that are quite stable, still have a decent growth potential and are not related to tech. 

Long story short I looked into companies that manufacture and distribute a variety of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and liquor as a long term investment. 

While demand for alcohol remained mostly intact (it declined a little bit due to bars/restaurants closing) during 2020, stock prices in this Industrie dropped and are slowly getting back to pre-pandemic levels, but they didn’t have this crazy growth like a lot of other companies within the last +6 months. 

The top companies in this industry have many attractive qualities. They have popular brands, which give them pricing power and strong cash flow. This allows them to pay dividends to shareholders. Alcohol stocks also tend to perform well during periods of economic downturns, meaning they can provide diversification and recession-resistance to a portfolio.

I also expect an increased consumption of alcoholic beverages after COVID restrictions get lifted. :)

Right now I looked into: 
$DEO (Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan, Baileys, Tanqueray, Guinness)

One of the largest beverage companies in the world, with a market capitalization near $100 billion. It is also one of the world’s oldest companies. 

Its financial results weakened in the most recent fiscal year. Global net sales declined 8% for fiscal 2020. But on the positive side, Diageo notched organic growth in North America for the fiscal year (The company’s biggest market at 39% of total revenue)

They‘re also investing heavily in under-developed nations around the world, which might hold them back in the short term but is likely to be a long-term tailwind.

$STZ 
Constellation Brands is a highly diversified company with more than 100 brands in its portfolio.

In the most recent quarter, revenue of $2.26 billion represented a mild decline of 3.6% from the previous quarter. However, earnings-per-share totaled $2.76, a 1.5% increase from the same quarter last year. 

Constellation is expected to continue generating growth in the years ahead, largely due to its premiumization strategy. In the most recent quarter, Constellation Brands saw at least 16% growth from its higher-end beer, spirits, and wine, compared with much lower growth from its lower-end brands.

And for all you Weed Stock lovers: $STZ has invested $4 billion in Canadian marijuana producer $CGC for a nearly 40% ownership stake. But not sure if this is good or bad. 

also looking into $BUD at the moment.

This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, we state that our policy decisions will be informed by our “assessments of shortfalls of employment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its maximum level.” This change means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market. Regarding our price stability goal, we state that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. This means that, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. With this change, we aim to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal. Well-anchored inflation expectations enhance our ability to meet both our employment and inflation goals, particularly in the current low interest rate environment in which our main policy tool is likely to be more frequently constrained by the lower bound.

1614088115.0|0.0|t3_lqit1o|18.0|"I think that two Fidelity ETFs deserve more attention.  Each is under 5 years old with an ER of 0.29%, each had a regularly scheduled rebalance just a day ago (so it's a good time to evaluate holdings), and each makes novel contributions to the factor ETF space.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **FCPI, Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF:** [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FCPI)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/Fidelity%20Stocks%20For%20Inflation%20Factor%20Index%20Methodology.pdf)

Described on page 5 of the methods doc, the ETF tracks an index that screens for value, quality, and momentum of stocks (a set of 11 total metrics, which I like for inflation protection due to the emphasis on free cash flow).  However, it also slightly biases sector weights (5% each) depending on historical correlation of sector performance with inflation.  So you get more weight on commodities-centric stocks, fewer tech and consumer discretionary stocks, etc (see page 7 of methods).  Its performance in the past year hasn't been amazing (it has been like VTV), but, inflation concerns did not really ramp up until very recently.  Also, the ETF index was reconstituted effective Monday, February 22 (see methods).  So if it's going to outperform a total market ETF, it's set up for it right now.  This is a small ETF by AUM and volume, so keep an eye on bid/ask spreads if you're dipping into it, but man, super appealing right now!

Having a look inside, you need to examine the daily holdings document since it was rebalanced more recently than the end-of-January summary holdings.  That's here: [http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&amp;applicationId=ETF&amp;securityId=316092386&amp;securityIdType=CUSIP&amp;critical=N](http://fundresearch.fidelity.com/prospectus/eproredirect?clientId=Fidelity&amp;applicationId=ETF&amp;securityId=316092386&amp;securityIdType=CUSIP&amp;critical=N) .  Top 10 holdings currently include:

AAPL, MSFT, EQT, WMB, EXP, NEM, CC, PG, GOOGL, PM.  Thus, it's heavy on free-cash-flow tech, oil/gas, materials, and consumer staples.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **FVAL, Fidelity Value Factor ETF**: [https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FVAL)

Methodology here: [https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR\_US\_Value\_Focus\_Methodology\_publicFNL.pdf](https://research2.fidelity.com/pi/Content/Documents/RebalanceSchedulesPDFs/FMR_US_Value_Focus_Methodology_publicFNL.pdf)

Many ""value factor"" ETFs have a near-exclusive focus on price/book ratio and earnings (or sales) to price.  This one is different in that is specifically calls out free cash flow yield and earnings to enterprise value metrics, which are also metrics that DSTL (the ""Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF"", another modern value/quality ETF @ [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl)) weights highly.  In fact, these value metrics are also used as the ""value"" metrics for FCPI. FVAL is not a simple ""value or growth"" classifier like some S&amp;P or CRSP value/growth factor ETFs.  It has consistently outperformed Vanguard's value ETF, VTV, probably as a result of using methods that can better reflect the effects of intangible value.  It was also rebalanced effective Monday, Feb. 22.  I think that this is the sort of ETF that may also outperform the market if meme growth tech stocks stagnate or there is mild inflation.

Its top holdings do include free-cash-flow tech starting with S&amp;P 500 stalwarts AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL and FB.  Many ""value"" ETFs will not be holding those tech leaders!  But after that that, FVAL takes a bit of a turn; one thing you won't find in either FVAL or FCPI is Tesla.  But FVAL does have classic value stocks such as Berkshire Hathaway and JNJ in its top 10.

It is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:

* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* S&amp;P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.
* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.

Which one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&amp;P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.

If you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're ""overvalued"". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.

Volatility is the price you pay for your returns.

If you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.

So here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with ""I own XYZ because..."". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio.

1614055274.0|0.0|t3_lq9eya|18.0|"Edit: I attempted to essentially front run comments about what this post is, but seems to not have worked. So let me put it here, at the very top:  **this is not a market call or a trade idea whatsoever- this is simply an observation. It’s not a speculation but on what the Fed might do, can do, can’t do, won’t do, etc etc. It is, again, nothing more than an observation of a ratio which holds no weight to anything.**

Due to COVID, the Federal Reserve established corporate credit facilities in which they essentially “threatened” to purchase corporate debt, specifically common ETFs in this space, including high yield. 

US high yield corporate credit (aka Junk or speculative debt) is, let’s call it, the riskiest of debt available to the broad investment community. It carries the highest yields and tends to have the sharpest volatility, even given its lower duration. 

On the equity front, it’s safe to say that small caps tend to be the most volatile (risky) of the broad US equity indices, i.e. Russell 2000 index. Some of the components that make up the index also have issued junk debt. The Fed did not stand up and facilities to support equity prices post COVID.

The chart below is intended to show the power of the Feds words, in my view. Yes, it’s imperfect, let me state this right now. It’s not intended to be anything more than this observation. 

The chart is simple: it takes the implied volatility of the Russell 2000 Index ($RVX) and divides that by the effective yield on US high yield corporate credit.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=BiWA

A general range for this ratio of 2-4 has history, even post GFC, however COVID has all but shifted this ratio much higher.

You can do the same from the large caps, i.e. $VIX (S&amp;amp;amp;P 500)... the results aren’t much different.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=BiXa

Now just imagine if the Fed had established a facility to buy equities... where might the RVX/VIX be at then? [Edit: yes, I’m well aware they do not have the authority to do so.]

In short, it is my opinion that the Feds actions, but much more so words, have suppressed volatility within the US high yield space and offered a floor for the market. And, I don’t expect this to end well... it brings back (terrible) memories of the SNB “having your back” at EUR 1.20... until one night, they gave up.

THREE QUICK NOTES:

1) I do submit that the data set is small, encompassing only one prior recession (GFC) but would argue that high yield has had it moments post-GFC, such as 2015/16 oil sell off when a large makeup of the high yield space was energy companies.

2) I also submit that current implied volatility levels are probably a function of a “crash up” bid, as opposed to hedging downside risk and/or speculating on falling prices. 

[Edit] 3) The lowering of the FF rate by the Fed has also contributed to the decline in high yields, as the 3yr UST note yields 20bps; therefore, high yield OAS has not made all time lows like effective yields have.


Regardless, I found this observation quite fascinating given the historically elevated implied volatility relative to the effective yield."|investing|The True Power of the Feds Words in a Single Chart|18.0|0.82

I'd love people's opinions about my take on the future of EV and whether I'm off base or too optimistic

Disclaimer: In NIO for 140 shares @ $22

My main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase

I would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of full self driving automation.

In the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially with the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in computational power ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023)) - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this technology aren't the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown exponentially in the past year. Like many people I'm viewing companies like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're main value is in the code they develop for automation.

Once full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

The main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that's only one company in the UK.

If automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily in and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to reach basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as service model along with the profit from actually selling the car and basically make drivers redundant

My argument is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon in their bookshop phase, people are betting that they'll sell lots of books (cars in this case because they're clean energy) and I think they're going to end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over our daily lives to the same extent amazon now does

Obvs I might be wrong and in fact I'd love to hear some bearish arguments - I'm not saying we're not in a bubble but I think these companies in 10 years time will be steals at their current prices

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people have mentioned the quantum computing point and how far we are away from it in normal conditions- which is a reasonable and valid point but I would argue that if you look at the rate of change of technological advances in the past 20 years (your phone in 2000 vs your phone now) - its not that crazy to say that this growth has risen exponentially and will carry on to meaning that **ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS** to full automation will be knocked down (i.e reaching the necessary computational power for an ML model to process images real time) and could act as a domino effect"|investing|Why EV isn't the bubble we think it is|154.0|0.69

**Constellation Brands**

In December 2019, [Canopy Growth Announces David Klein as New Chief Executive Officer](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canopy-growth-announces-david-klein-as-new-chief-executive-officer-300971074.html). 

&gt;David brings a wealth of expertise to this role, having served in a number of senior leadership capacities over the past 14 years at Constellation Brands. His capabilities include extensive CPG and beverage alcohol industry experience, strong financial orientation, and experience operating in highly regulated markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe. David is an experienced strategist with a deep understanding of how to build enduring consumer brands while leveraging operational scale across a dispersed production footprint. He is a strong leader with a proven track record of developing diverse and high performing teams.

In a recent interview, David Klien said *“It's past time that cannabis was legalized in the U.S. We're quite encouraged by Senators Booker, Wyden, and Schumer beginning to talk about making cannabis part of their overall criminal justice reform work that they would prioritize during this Senate,""* - and Canopy Growth has consistently maintained it only needs federal permissibility to launch its U.S. plans.

**Acreage/US Legalization**

In April 2019, Canopy Growth [Announced Plan to Acquire Leading U.S. Multi-State Cannabis Operator, Acreage Holdings](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canopy-growth-announces-plan-to-acquire-leading-us-multi-state-cannabis-operator-acreage-holdings-300834628.html)

[Acreage Holdings ](https://www.acreageholdings.com/about-us/) cemented its place as an industry game-changer during this period. Board appointments from across the political and commercial spectrum helped legitimize cannabis among investors and regulators. Press coverage of the broadcast TV rejection of our “Time Is Now” Super Bowl PSA, which called for further cannabis reform, reached billions. We began rolling out our house of brands, including consumer brands like The Botanist and Live Resin Project, both of which took home honors at the Emerald Cup, the premier product competition in cannabis. And we entered an arrangement with Canopy Growth Corporation, setting the stage for a combined global cannabis powerhouse once it’s federally permissible for Canopy to acquire our company

The new — and complicated — agreement, which would allow Canopy to buy Acreage once pot is federally legalized in the U.S., follows broader efforts by both companies and North American's legal marijuana industry to cut costs and shrink their footprint.

&gt;Canopy CEO David Klein said the move ""reflects Canopy Growth's commitment to focusing our efforts on the United States as one of our three core markets. Acreage continues to be Canopy's main point of entry into the largest THC marketplace in the world when federally permissible.""

Under the new deal, Canopy would not have to buy as much of Acreage. It would be obligated to buy only 70% of Acreage whenever the U.S. legalized cannabis, Acreage said.

Fixed Acreage shares will be exchanged for 0.3048 shares of Canopy, down from 0.5818 previously. Canopy Growth has the option to buy the floating shares for a price of at least $6.41. Shareholders also get a $37.5 million one-time payment. Canopy will also loan up to $100 million to a subsidiary of Acreage.

I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8ogt7/the_green_rush_weedstocks_us_legalization/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) in regards to my bullish stance on US Legalization &amp;amp; and the oppotunities ahead. Imo, Canopy Growth (along with top Cannadian LPs/MSOs) will be first in line to benefit.

**Canopy Rivers/TerrAscend**

Rivers to receive $115 million in cash and 3,750,000 common shares of Canopy Growth and cancel all 36,468,318 Multiple Voting Shares and the 15,223,938 Subordinate Voting Shares of Rivers held by Canopy Growth.

1) Can you please describe the relationship with Canopy?  CGC's investor presentation has TerrAscend as a key pillar to their US strategy yet I believe they own or will own less than 30%...Sounds to me that Canopy will want to acquire a controlling interest as soon as legally permitted?  Is that accurate?

&gt;Canopy owns about 20% of the company on an as converted basis. We have a great relationship and were flattered that they highlight TerrAscend as a key pillar. In terms of whether they want to acquire controlling interest in the company, you'd have to ask them. 

2) too add on to this.. Like mentioned above, TER is a key pillar to Canopy’s US strategy, but does that fit both sides of the coin?

&gt;Yes, the relationship is mutually beneficial. We talk to them regularly. They have alot of great insight and are generous with their time and resources. For example: Their advice has been very helpful as it relates to our buildout in New Jersey.

1614043402.0|0.0|t3_lq5kyd|12.0|"For a long time, folks covering the US MSO industry have been talking about the Big 4 ($GTBIF, $CURLF, $CRLBF, and $TCNNF), but its time we started talking about the Big 5 with the newest addition being Verano Holdings ($VRNOF) which went public last Wednesday. Below is my investment thesis on $VRNOF.

**TL;dr: The stock is a high-quality way to play the coming US cannabis wave and could be a 2-3.5x over the next year. I believe this will be a stock that institutions will gravitate towards. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and $VRNOF has one of the best management teams, several growth drivers, best-in-class margin profile, and trades at a discount to its Big 4 peers. The company went public last week and is still under-the-radar.**

*Note: the company is listed in Canada under $VRNO and is available over-the-counter under $VRNOF.*

Current Price / Market Cap: $24.44 / $7.1Bn

**Thesis**

* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales
* Attractive 14-state footprint
   * Core markets of IL, FL, MD, AZ, NJ, and PA are large and projected to grow above the industry average rate over the next 2-3 years
      * IL one of the best adult-use states in the US
      * AZ just started adult use sales at the beginning of 2021 and is poised to see significant growth
      * NJ just approved adult use sales; recreational sales likely to start in early 2022 but could be sooner
      * FL, PA, and MD could enact adult-use legislation in the next 2-3 years
   * Near-term development markets (2021+): MA, NV, OH, MI, AR
   * Longer-term development markets (2022+): WV, CA, MO
* Strong financial profile makes $VRNOF a top 3 MSO
   * 40%+ EBITDA margins currently places it #3 behind $TCNNF and $AYRWF; potential for $VRNOF to become #2 in 2021
   * Expected 2021 EBITDA of $350MM likely places it #2/3 amongst all MSOs (excluding any new M&amp;A)
   * Anticipate tuck-in acquisitions in core markets that would provide upside to these numbers, namely AZ (dispensaries) and PA (dispensaries and cultivation)
   * No debt; has issued equity sparingly
* Strong management with significant insider ownership
   * Conversations with folks in the industry suggest $VRNOF is one of the best, if not the best, operator in the industry (as evidenced by the large EBITDA margins on a broad footprint)
   * Total insider ownership: 20%+
   * CEO (George Archos) ownership: \~19%
* Several industry catalysts including:
   * Federal decriminalization of cannabis
   * Banking bill would allow cannabis businesses to access the banking system, reduce their cost of capital, improve their margin profiles, make customer transactions more seamless, and allow $VRNOF to list on a major exchange
   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH
* $VRNOF trading at a 25% discount to other large, diversified MSO peers ($GTBIF/$CURLF/$CRLBF)
   * $VRNOF trading at 14.5x 2022 EBITDA vs. $GTBIF (21.1x)/$CURLF (19.1x)/$CRLBF (18x)
* Pre-public private round was 5x oversubscribed with largely institutional participation. Demonstrates institutional interest in the company.

**What is the stock worth?**

* Amongst the Big 4, $GTBIF is $VRNOF's best comp. The companies have diversified footprints in limited-license states and the CEOs of both companies are regarded as amongst the best in the industry. $GTBIF trades at 21x 2022 EBITDA vs. $VRNOF at $14.5x. If $VRNOF trades in-line with $GTBIF, the stock could see 45% upside…
* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 30x EBITDA ($50 target price - 2x upside)? 40x ($67)? 50x ($83 - 3.5x upside)? I believe the stock (and group) will re-rate higher as we get positive news throughout 2021 around state legalization plans, earnings, and potentially federal action
* How does the valuation gap close? Now that the company is public, I expect it to increase its profile and share its story through attending conferences, speaking to investors, etc. I also anticipate we will see research firms initiate coverage on the stock over the next 3-6 months. Continued execution will also be a driver.

* Execution missteps
* Regulatory changes that restrict cannabis sales and/or how cannabis can be sold (industry risk)

One such example is the claim that you'll do a lot better by just sticking to total market ETFs because the ""studies say so and that retail investors usually underperform unless their money is being managed by someone else (either a passive or active fund)"".

for retail investors:

1. These studies are looking at *everyone*. From day traders, to swing traders to people who don’t know basic tenants such as time in the market beats timing the market. If you don’t day trade, if you don’t invest only for the short term and don’t try to time the market, why would you look at a study where a significant portion of the population is doing exactly that? What about studies that look at just long term investors, who know what the hell they're doing and who aren't constantly trading?
2. These studies are looking at a time period that's not really applicable to today's investors. A lot of communities and tools on the Internet either did not exist 10-15+ years ago or did not yet mature to the same level of sophistication that they're at right now. I don't think it's possible to overestimate how big of a deal the Internet has been in empower retail investors.

But the ""studies"" say that 95% professional traders underperform as well. So what makes you think you'll do any better?:

1. It’s much harder to generate alpha when you’re managing 10s of billions of dollars.
2. Fund managers have rules and regulations that they’re forced to follow and many can only allocate a small percentage of their portfolios in their “top 5 ideas” due to risk management policies for example.
3. Many aren’t even trying to beat the market but are staying within their own benchmarks they’ve set for their customers, and for this reason they’re mostly doing short term trading. Which means they'll most likely underperform long term oriented portfolios over 10-15+ year periods.

&amp;#x200B;

As Warren Buffet said ""Investing is the only field in the world where the amateur can very likely do better than the professional. As long as they are self aware that they are in fact amateurs."" and ""When I was younger I had more ideas than money, now that I'm managing hundreds of billions of. dollars I have more money than ideas.""

I’m not saying that you *shouldn’t* invest in index funds at all. I’m just saying that the arguments I’ve read about why you should ""just stick to total market index funds, because the studies say you should"", seem shallow and may not be applicable to a lot of people in this subreddit or people who take a serious interest in investing."|investing|"Why I'm skeptical of ""just stick to total market index funds, because the studies say you should"" ."|11.0|0.56

Having somewhat of a background in corporate governance, but no background in cryptocurrency and blockchain, this concerns me as a stockholder or as a board member.  But I suspect it is due to my own ignorance of blockchain.

My concern is that, with the alleged anonymity of bitcoin, wouldn't it be super easy for an employee to steal that bitcoin and get away with it?  My understanding is that bitcoin is stored in a secured virtual wallet and a passcode is needed to access it.  So whomever has that passcode can just move money to their own anonymous wallet.

So how do companies handle that?  Obviously, some companies are holding the bitcoin themselves and hold it through a broker or some other 3rd party.  But then that 3rd party has the same issue.  Even the new Bitcoin ETF - if they hold the bitcoin themselves, how do they secure it?

My understanding is that every bitcoin is in a wallet somewhere.  And that wallet is accessible - anonymously - by anyone who has the passcode.  Just seems like a very easy embezzlement opportunity.

Osprey Technology Acquisition Corp. (SFTW) [is reverse-merging](https://spacenews.com/satellite-imagery-and-data-firm-blacksky-to-go-public-in-latest-spac-deal/) with BlackSky, a “real-time geospatial intelligence, imagery, and data analytics company”. Quick numbers from the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45d790e595130001acce06/t/602d836852a6161779071daa/1613595497169/Eagle+Eye+Investor+Presentation+%282.17.2021%29_vFinal2.pdf):

· Pro forma EV = $1.1 billion

· SFTW trust = $318 million

· PIPE = $180 million. Investors include Mithril Capital (Peter Thiel) Hedosophia, and Tiger Global.

· Ownership: 63% existing shareholders, 21% SPAC shares, 4% founder shares, and 12% PIPE.

**Thesis statement:**

BlackSky is a disruptive, vertically integrated business model that removes the barriers-to-entry historically present in the utilization of satellite imagery, which in the past has severely limited utility and application in the private sector. BlackSky reduces the cost of image acquisition by 90% compared to existing competition and their Spectra SaaS works to democratize access to petabyte-scale imagery and AI/ML analytics. Longer-term, satellite imagery will be in use across all major industries including but not limited to agriculture, security, mining, and insurance, offering an absolutely massive TAM.

*My background:* Research scientist using remote sensing (satellite observations) and machine learning to better monitor, model, and predict changes to natural terrestrial processes

*My positions:* Warrants and shares.

*Financial advice:* I’m not an advisor and this is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

Ok, lets get into it…

**What is satellite imagery?**

When you think of satellite imagery, you probably picture something like Google Earth, which is just RGB images over the Earth’s surface but really imagery comes from both [passive and active sensors](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/remote-sensors). Sensors from the Landsat and Sentinel missions, for ex, measure radiation along the electromagnetic spectrum from 400nm up to as high as [13,000nm](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-9/landsat-9-spectral-bands). For reference, visible light is 400nm to 700nm.

**So, what is BlackSky?**

BlackSky is a geospatial intelligence company. What does that mean? As usual, the best definition comes from Wikipedia:

“Geospatial intelligence is intelligence about the human activity on earth derived from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes, assesses, and visually depicts physical features and geographically references activities on Earth.”

BlackSky was born as one of three primary business services within parent company Spaceflight Industries, with the other two services being (1) excess capacity reselling “rideshare” business, [sold off](https://www.blacksky.com/2020/02/11/spaceflight-industries-signs-definitive-agreement-to-sell-spaceflight-rideshare-to-mitsui-and-yamasa/) in Feb 2020, and (2) LeoStella, a joint venture with Thales Alenia Space, that manufactures [smallsats](https://www.blacksky.com/what-is-a-smallsat/). For the SPAC merger, the name Spaceflight Industries is being dropped in favor of BlackSky, which will own a 50% stake in LeoStella.

BlackSky has a vertically integrated business model that starts with the manufacturing of the actual satellites themselves and finishes with an AI/ML-driven data analytics product. Lets work our way from start to finish.

**Business Model Part 1 - Satellite development and launch**

First, BlackSky [builds smallsats](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/leostella-confirms-delivery-blackskys-earth-observation-satellites-spacex-launch/), via their 50% stake in LeoStella, which they then launch into [low earth orbit](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2020/03/Low_Earth_orbit) (LEO, most common orbital path for observational systems). The actual launches are performed through outside companies. For example, BlackSky launched two satellites on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in [August 2020](https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-starlink-and-blacksky-satellites/).  Currently, 5 satellites are in orbit and another 16 are in production with plans to be in orbit by the end of 2021, as well as [another 4 spare satellites](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/blacksky-will-add-sharper-focus-night-vision-next-gen-earth-watching-satellites/) ready to deploy when necessary. The primary competition, Maxar, outsources satellite manufacturing to Raytheon while Airbus builds their satellites in-house.

What about costs? BlackSky satellites are **MUCH** less expensive to develop and launch than the largest competition. For example, Maxar’s previous program, WorldView-4 (single satellite), cost $850 million and [was lost in 2019](https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/maxar-technologies-reports-failure-of-its-worldview-4-imaging-satellite/#:~:text=USA%3A%20Maxar%20Technologies%20has%20reported,of%20an%20axis%20of%20stability.&amp;text=If%20the%20satellite%20is%20not,written%20off%20in%20Q4%2D2018.) due to technical failure. Their newest program is WorldView Legion, with an estimated cost of about [$600 million](https://spacenews.com/worldview-legion-pandemic/#:~:text=The%20initial%20block%20of%20six,an%20%24850%20million%20price%20tag.) to build and launch the 6 satellites ($100 million each) making up their constellation. The other competition, Airbus, is launching the [first two satellites](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2020/10/pleiades-neo-set-for-launch-in-early-2021.html) in their 4-satellite Pleiades Neo constellation in 2021. Cost to build and launch the four satellites is [approximately $232 million](https://spacenews.com/airbus-to-build-four-imaging-satellites-for-french-space-agency-mulls-20-plus-constellation/), averaging $58 million per satellites, with cost split between Airbus and the French Space Agency CNES. In comparison, BlackSky was able to build and launch their Pathfinder-1 satellite at a total cost of just [$10 million](https://www.blacksky.com/2016/11/14/spaceflight-industries-shares-first-images-from-blacksky-pathfinder-satellite-claims-mission-success/)! What this means is that the monthly cost of imagery for a 25 sqkm site is just **$12,000** through BlackSky (p. 10, [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45d790e595130001acce06/t/602d836852a6161779071daa/1613595497169/Eagle+Eye+Investor+Presentation+%282.17.2021%29_vFinal2.pdf)), **whereas** **legacy competition costs up to $120,000.** This is extremely important for tech updates and innovation, as well as competitive pricing. BlackSky can deploy new satellites with improved sensor capabilities extremely quickly and for relatively low cost.

**Business Model Part 2 - Satellite imagery**

This is where the debate over the imagery itself comes in. The main competition, at least in terms of generating the satellite imagery itself, are Maxar (WorldView Legion) and Airbus (Pleiades Neo), both of which are moving towards satellites with 30-cm and [50-cm](https://spacenews.com/airbus-to-build-four-imaging-satellites-for-french-space-agency-mulls-20-plus-constellation/) resolution, respectively. Meanwhile, BlackSky’s imagery from the previous generation (Gen-2) satellites are just 100-cm. Is this a problem? No. Because smallsats are so quickly produced, and because BlackSky owns the underlying manufacturer, successive generations are becoming more and more advanced. For example, the current [Gen-3 satellites](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/blacksky-will-add-sharper-focus-night-vision-next-gen-earth-watching-satellites/) host 50-cm resolution as well as short-wave infrared readings, providing night-vision imagery and smoke/haze cut-through. So in the short-term, BlackSky has lower resolution imagery than Maxar, and matching Airbus, but can improve and adapt their sensors much more quickly, and for far **FAR** lower cost than the competition. This is one of the reasons the company was [awarded a contract](https://www.blacksky.com/2020/09/24/blacksky-dual-payload-satellite-architecture-resolution-nighttime-imaging/#:~:text=The%20commercial%20constellation%20expansion%20features,%2Dwave%20infrared%20(SWIR).) with the U.S. Army Defense Innovation Unit.

The best competition against BlackSky are other private companies working to scale up large-count nanosat, microsat, and smallsat constellations, such as Planet (closest competitor, imo), Satellogic, and ICEYE. Honestly, if any of these were to go public via SPAC I’d be as excited to jump in on them as I am on BlackSky. Lets go over some numbers for each.

**Planet** (great company, as per anecdotal evidence from colleagues) utilizes a constellation of 130+ shoebox satellites that are even cheaper to construct and deploy than the smallsats operated by BlackSky. Planet has a couple advantages over BlackSky, namely their existing satellite network, robust data lake, and low cost of deployment. But spatial resolution of their imagery is 6-10x coarser, ranging from 300-500 cm (3-5m), which results in a pretty significant divide in use cases between the two companies. The cheaper, lower resolution data from Planet may be more useful for general purpose applications, such as approximating agricultural production and monitoring large-vehicle traffic (shipping, aircraft). But for larger organizations more fiscally invested in the outcome of satellite imaging monitoring, such as agricultural companies in California, Wall Street hedge funds incorporating imagery into models, or insurance companies measuring impacts of natural disasters, it’s much more likely they would select the much finer-resolution data products. I think that if Planet were to public it would be a lower-risk but lower-reward choice compared to BlackSky.

**Satellogic** (based out of Buenos Aires) hosts a 10 nanosat constellation producing 70-100cm resolution spectral and 30 meter hyperspectral imagery. Series B round in 2017 was led by [Tencent](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/Tencent%20https:/spacenews.com/satellogic-raises-27-million-round-for-hyperspectral-imaging-constellation/), so great vote of confidence there and a 2019 round of funding, also partly funded by Tencent, raised another [$50 million](https://spacenews.com/satellogic-raises-50-million-to-build-out-imaging-constellation/). Satellogic is unique from the other companies in that they are targeting a government customer base, with the goal of selling exclusive access and control over their fleet to municipal, state, and natl governments (caveat: from Wikipedia with outdated reference). Expected customer charges are $2 million/satellite per year, for a revenue stream of $20 million/year for the existing fleet.

**ICEYE** (Finnish) has [10 existing microsats](https://www.iceye.com/sar-data/orbits) in orbit, each at a cost of approximately [$3 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/iceye-building-worlds-largest-sar-constellation-with-microsatellites.html) (estimated in 2018), with plans to launch another 8 by the end of 2022. ICEYE differentiates itself from other smallsat companies by using [Synthetic Aperture Radar](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/what-is-sar) (SAR), an active sensor that uses longer wavelengths to see through clouds, haze, and foliage at fine resolution. [Downsides](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=spacegrant) to SAR are that it results in slower acquisition speed due to higher modeling costs (ICEYE has a turnaround time of 12 hours, compared to under 2 hours for BlackSky), greater energy consumption and thus decreased sensor lifespan, and lower image coherence for non-stationary objects. ICEYE raised [$34 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/01/iceye-building-worlds-largest-sar-constellation-with-microsatellites.html) in 2018, and [existing customers](https://www.iceye.com/company/customers) are primarily research institutions.

Some other example competitors are [Spire](https://spire.com/) and [HawkEye360](https://www.he360.com/), which we don’t have time to get into here. But an important point about the companies listed above is the amount of funding they have raised in the past, which is generally 1/10th the amount provided ($320 million) to BlackSky by the merger with SFTW. I believe this will provide a massive boost forward for BlackSky against the competition, providing funding for both further expansion of their constellation as well as greater build-out of their unique Spectra platform (see below). Their strongest competitor, Planet, raised [$168 million](https://www.planet.com/pulse/planet-closes-168m-series-d-financing/) last year, and so will likely be aggressively expanding as well. However, given the absolutely massive TAM, there is plenty of room for several satellite constellation companies in the market.

**Business Model Part 3 - Cloud-based analytics via ML/AI**

This is where I think my expertise and personal experience with satellite imagery comes in to play. Let me explain to you how, historically, working with satellite imagery went: you access a server, you pull *individual images* (usually in GeoTIFF format) to your local machine, and you process them. If you’re working on the scale of 1 sqkm, it’s not that big of a deal. But if you’re working over larger areas, such as cities, states, mountain ranges, seas, continents, etc., all of a sudden you’re dealing with terabytes, or more often, petabytes of data. Clearly, the old method of accessing individual images doesn’t work anymore. The data is too large to pull in the first place, plus the processing times would be obscene (think days, months, years) because (a) your local system doesn’t have enough cores, (b) common process/analysis methods aren’t optimized for massively parallel computing via HPC or cloud systems.

What changed in the last few years was the advent of cloud computing for geospatial data processing. In terms of research, [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) (GEE) completely changed the game. They put together a massive [data catalogue](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) of almost all publicly accessible satellite imagery going back to the early 1980’s, hosting petabytes of data. GEE combined this with their own JS libraries, code editor, and APIs to allow users to access, manipulate, and analyze petabytes of data in seconds using Google’s cloud platform. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this, and it’s one of the reasons I’m so bullish on BlackSky.

See, BlackSky is not just a satellite imagery company. The reality is that they are also a data analytics company. Before now, if a company wanted to utilize satellite imagery, they would need a full team of scientists with geospatial, cloud, machine learning, and AI experts. What BlackSky, Maxar, and Airbus do is provide access to their datasets hosted on cloud systems. But what differentiates BlackSky from the competition is their SaaS product **Spectra** ([2017 press release](https://www.blacksky.com/2017/04/04/introducing-blacksky-spectra/), [2020 press release](http://www.parabolicarc.com/2020/04/22/blacksky-launches-spectra-on-demand-secure-bundle-for-intelligence-analysts/)). Spectra allows clients to access imagery on-demand with built-in AI/ML tools, streamline a mountain of external monitoring datasets, ability to access or purchase additional public or proprietary datasets, **manually task the satellites yourself**, etc. Case-in-point, [job listings](https://www.blacksky.com/careers/) on the BlackSky website are concentrated on cloud, software, and ML/AI positions, plus some business director positions. Engineers are working over at LeoStella, leaving BlackSky with the ability to focus on growing sales and building out their SaaS platform. Importantly, the CEO Brian O’Toole is the former founder/CEO of OpenWhere, [purchased by BlackSky](https://xconomy.com/seattle/2016/06/21/spaceflight-industries-raises-18m-acquires-openwhere/) (then Spaceflight Industries) in 2016, which developed a “web-scale software platform for customers to rapidly request, receive and interact with satellite imagery via the internet or even a mobile phone” \[[via PitchBook](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/61381-45)\]. So BlackSky, then led by founder (and serial entrepreneur) Jason Andrews, purchased OpenWhere and handed over the position of CEO to the now-former CEO of OpenWhere. Pretty strong statement that they are focusing not just on imagery itself but also on the **accessibility** of that data.

What does this mean? Say a mining company wants to incorporate satellite imagery into the security monitoring system of their open pit mines in Australia. Previously, this wouldn’t have been feasible - it would have required purchasing imagery from Maxar or Airbus, then having experts on staff to work with the imagery, integrate with external data sources, and build out automated alert/monitoring procedures. With Spectra, the mining company can simply sign up for a subscription plan and security personnel can utilize the data without any expertise or skills relating to data science or geo-analytics.

Given this, I believe BlackSky begs comparison with name-brand growth companies like Snowflake and Palantir. Through Snowflake, a company can utilize cloud storage/access services without a full team of cloud engineers/architects. Through Palantir, a company (or gov. org.) can utilize AI/ML methods without a full team of expert statisticians. Through BlackSky, a company can utilize massive proprietary and public satellite imagery through built-in AI/ML methods without a team composed of geospatial, cloud, software eng., and stat experts.

This is why slides 29-30 in the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d45d790e595130001acce06/t/602d836852a6161779071daa/1613595497169/Eagle+Eye+Investor+Presentation+%282.17.2021%29_vFinal2.pdf) compare BlackSky with both space tech companies (NPA/AST, SRAC/Momentus, Maxar, Airbus, etc.) as well data analytics companies (elastic, Datadog, Palantir, etc.). In terms of existing and projected revenue, BlackSky beats out the other incoming SPAC companies, though their 2020A revenue of $22 million is effectively insignificant relative to their $1.1 billion valuation, so I wouldn’t put too much weight on that comparison. Additionally, BlackSky is targeting completely different markets than Momentus and AST.

**Company Management**

· Brian O’Toole, CEO - GeoEye, GE Aerospace, OpenWhere

· Peter Wagner, CTO - Spaceflight Industries, Dir. of DoD Op. Resp. Space Office,  Stanford &amp; UWY educ.

· Nick Merski, COO - U.S Air Force

· Patrick O’Neil, Chief Data Sci - Board member for Center for Mathematics and AI; PhD mathematics GMU

· Nick Tabbal, VP - JOT Analytics, comScore

· Scott Herman, Chief Solns Arch - GeoEye, VisualCV

**Economics**

· 2020A Revenue= $22 million

· 2025E Revenue = $546 million (tenuous, as per the SPAC way)

· Margin on imagery = 90% (accounts for 64% of revenue)

· Margin on Saas product = 60% (accounts for 30% of revenue)

· Contract pipeline = $1.7 billion, though contracts can be fungible so this number is far from guaranteed

· Existing partnerships (mostly government): National Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, IARPA, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army (taken from inv. pres.)

· BlackSky EV/CY’22E = 9.7x. Compared against SRAC/Momentus at 27x, Snowflake at 54x, Palantir at 44x, MongoDB at 27x, Elastic at 17x.

**Misc. thoughts**

Obviously, BlackSky is a target for the ARKX fund whenever it launches. In my opinion, that’s almost guaranteed. However, I also think that ARKW (holding Palantir) should be considered a target fund as well, given the data focus of BlackSky. This isn’t to say that Ark purchases are a sole reason to buy, but if/when those purchases occur that would be a significant catalyst for share price to move above the current $14-15 range. Additionally, Ark purchases give buyers more confidence in companies like this (those with high valuations but little to no existing revenue) and so would provide a general floor price to the shares. That, combined with existing investments from Peter Thiel (Mithril Capital), Hedosophia, and Tiger Global, make for a pretty solid foundation of successful investors. So if you’re a swing trader and don’t like to hold past merger, buying prior to any Ark investments could be profitable. Personally, I see this as one of the only strong candidates (among the low-/no-revenue SPACs) to hold long-term. That being said, it is still a more speculative investment than SKLZ (my baby) or other SPACs with more established revenue. If run-up is significant going into merger, I’ll probably convert a portion of warrants to shares to reduce volatility a bit.

**Conclusion**

BlackSky offers disruptive tech, in terms of (a) hardware - satellites, (b) data - imagery, and (c) analytics - Spectra SaaS. All of this is built into a vertically integrated business that yields costs which are just a fraction (\~1/10th) of their competitors (Maxar and Airbus), but maintain a much more versatile, innovative, and adaptable constellation of satellites. Satellites are built in-house via 50% ownership of LeoStella, imagery is competitive in quality with that from Maxar and Airbus but with much greater ability to improve with progressing technology due to significantly lower cost &amp; time for construction of new satellites, and the Spectra SaaS allows companies to utilize advanced processing and AI/ML geospatial methods on-demand without the need for additional employees. Existing nanosat and microsat private competition are out there, but funds raised from the merger with SFTW will provide BlackSky with an almost unparalleled opportunity to achieve first-mover advantage.

**Who is AGTC?**

AGTC is a Biopharmaceutical company that focuses on gene therapies to treat rare inherited genetic conditions. They specialize in treating eye conditions, and have a substantial pipeline with promising results. This pipeline includes treatment for X-Linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP), which is in extended phase 2 clinical trials. They are also in clinical trials for a treatment of Achromatopsia. You can see their full pipeline here: [https://agtc.com/programs/](https://agtc.com/programs/)

**What is XLRP?** 

**""**Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) describes a group of rare genetic eye diseases that damage light-sensitive cells in the retina, leading to loss of sight over time. In about 10% of RP cases, the non-working gene is passed down from the mother to her children resulting in a form of RP known as X-Linked RP (XLRP). For more information about how retinitis pigmentosa is inherited and the impact on the vision of male and female children, please go to [https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa.](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa)

XLRP causes gradual vision loss in boys and young men. The disease begins with night blindness and is followed by a slow narrowing of the peripheral field of vision. In general, the decline in vision (also referred to as “visual acuity”) results in a person becoming legally blind in their 40s.""

**Catalysts**

AGTC recently took part in the OIS Gene Therapy Innovation Showcase and showed extremely promising results from their XLRP trials. I watched the conference and CEO Sue Washer spoke clearly and confidently about their results. Unfortunately the YouTube video was made private, and I am unable to locate it anywhere. If I find a link I will update this post. 

AGTC is also presenting this week at the 4th annual Gene Therapy for Rare Disorders digital event. Information on this event can be found here: [https://genetherapy-conference.com/](https://genetherapy-conference.com/) 

AGTC currently has a strong buy rating with an average price target of $16.71. Low price target is $9, high price target is $35. Right now looks like a perfect entry point, and I have spent the day averaging down during the dip. [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AGTC/research-ratings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AGTC/research-ratings)

The analyst that gave a $35 PT is Zegbeh Jallah Ph D, a senior research analyst in the biotech sector for Roth Capital. I tend to listen to voices such as hers! 

AGTC is also speculated to be a buyout candidate by Sanofi. These are just rumors, but there is a lot of reason to be optimistic moving forward! 

**Institutional Ownership**

According to Fintel, AGTC has institutional ownership pushing 40%. This is generally a great sign for retail investors. Institutions generally don't invest in failing companies. [https://fintel.io/so/us/agtc](https://fintel.io/so/us/agtc)

**Competitors**

AGTC isn't the only company that is developing XLRP therapy. Currently the two main competitors are Biogen (BIIB) and Mieragtx (MGTX). Both of these companies are also in clinical trials for their XLRP treatment, but what sets AGTC apart is the efficacy and safety of their treatments. Compared to their competitors, AGTC's therapy is not only more effective, but also has far fewer incidents of negative side effects. 

Recently AGTC went through a big pump. On Feb 1 the stock was trading right around $4 and shot up all the way to $9+ by 2/11, and again on 2/17. The last few days of trading we are seeing a steady pullback, with a share price of $6.39 at the time of writing. This presents a fantastic entry point in my opinion. With an average price target of $16+, AGTC could easily see 150% growth over the next 12 months, with potential to soar well above that if the clinical trials continue to show positive results. 

There isn't much to dislike about this company. Their leadership team is extremely seasoned, they are narrowly focused, their trials show incredible promise and they are the clear front runners among their competitors for XLRP treatment!

Finally, billionaire money managers and 13F filers fancied electric-vehicle (EV) kingpin Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) in the fourth quarter. A grand total of 1,949 funds now hold Tesla stock, which is up 318 from the sequential third quarter. BlackRock upped its holdings in the company by almost 12.1 million shares, with (surprise!) Susquehanna adding 1.5 million shares. You could safely say that Jeff Yass' team sought out growth stocks in Q4.

The bullishness surrounding Tesla has to do with the company's success in developing mass-produced, affordable EVs. Tesla is the first auto company to build itself from the ground up to mass production in over five decades. Last year, it missed CEO Elon Musk's target of 500,000 deliveries by a mere 450 EVs. The company also produced its first full year of profits.

Then again, Tesla's profitability has been contingent on the sale of renewable energy credits to other automakers. Excluding these credits, the company still isn't profitable despite selling close to 500,000 EVs on an annual basis.

With the recent dip, continued increase in ecommerce package volume, and Stamps.com’s international expansion, STMP is poised to be a good play in Q1 and going forward.



**This is post is not financial advice.**

**Background**

Firstly, no, Stamps.com doesn’t sell stamps. They are a SaaS company that offers a variety of shipping, mailing, and tracking solutions for small to enterprise level businesses. Despite its awful name, Stamps.com is a large player in ecommerce. Chances are, if you have shopped online, then you have received a package sent via Stamps.com. Over 40% of all First-Class packages and 33% of Priority Mail packages sent in the US use postage purchased with a Stamps.com software. In the past two years, they also signed a deal strengthening their partnership with UPS and acquired key European/Asian player, MetaPack.


**Recent Performance**

* 2020 was the best year to date, capped off by Q4 crushing earnings estimates
* Total revenue was $206.0 million, up 28% compared to $160.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.

* GAAP net income was $46.5 million, up 129% compared to $20.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.
* Still has an awful name.

**Effects of COVID-19 on STMP in 2020**

In last week’s earnings call the Stamps.com CEO stated:
&gt;  COVID-19 continues to have a significant positive impact on our business with significant growth in both customers and shipping volume. U.S. e-commerce activity remained elevated throughout the fourth quarter and we benefited from that. 

He later when on to say:

&gt;  The growth in revenue in the fourth quarter and for the year was primarily driven by strong shipping growth attributable to the shift to online e-commerce purchasing that has been driven by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.

So, from these statements, it’s pretty clear that Stamps.com’s leadership believes that their business befits from consumers’ increased inclination to shop online during the Covid pandemic...

**Q1 Guidance from Stamps.com (or lack thereof)**

...but contrary to the statements above, they went on to cite Covid as a source of uncertainty. Despite being halfway through Q1, and continued YoY growth for ecommerce activity throughout the US, Stamps.com did not provide guidance for Q1. Instead, they stated:
&gt;  …as we look forward to 2021, the myriad of factors that are beyond our control, and the resulting effects that those factors could have on our business are very difficult to accurately forecast.
&gt; These factors include as; global macroeconomic risks, associated with the ongoing pandemic; timing and degree of moderation, in Safer at Home restrictions; the shift back to an office-based working environment; and the overall changes those things could have on global e-commerce.

**Covid Uncertainty doesn’t really apply to Q1**

It’s hard to imagine a scenario where Covid doesn’t have a net positive impact on Stamps.com in Q1. The rest of 2021 may be hard to predict for ecommerce, but Q1 is almost halfway over, and baring an ~80% slowdown for the next month, there will likely be a YoY increase in package volume. Beyond Q1, it will be interesting to see just how much shoppers will stick with their increased propensity to shop online.

**Future expansion**

Stamps.com has acquired Endicia, ShipStation, ShipEngine, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, and MetaPack. Though Stamps.com initially started with an exclusive USPS partnership, these acquisitions have opened the door for partnerships with private (UPS, FedEx) and international (Canada Post, Royal Mail, etc.) package carriers. In 2021 Stamps.com expects a 20% increase in operating costs, primarily as a result of increasing headcount and working to develop international business. Stamps.com has only gotten their toes wet in the international market (MetaPack being a huge key to this market), and with their track record, I wouldn’t be surprised if their international business eventually surpassed domestic business.

**Stock Buybacks and Neutral Outlooks**

In the past, the tin foil hat-wearing redditors among us have accused Stamps.com of offering neutral guidance in an attempt to lower share price just before large buybacks. I don't usually bust out my aluminum fedora, but I'll just leave these bullet points here below.

* 2020 was the biggest year for STMP by far
* Q4 crushed earnings estimates
* Q1 2021 was halfway over by the time of the 2020 earnings call
* Despite more uncertainty in 2020 than Q1 2021 they provided guidance for all 4 quarters last year
* Share price dropped ~$70 as a result of no guidance

* $60M in stock repurchases were approved through the summer 

**TLDR;**
This is a good stock. Lack of guidance caused a sell-off. This is still a good stock. Stamps.com has a terrible name."|investing|$STMP Dropped 25% after crushing all earnings estimates and Declining to offer guidance. The Bullish case for Stamps.com.|57.0|0.87

Hey everyone! 

So, full disclaimer- although I have been trading for quite some time now- I am not an expert at interpreting technical data on stocks, but I’m making this bullish thesis based on my understandings as someone studying International Development. 

So, to begin I’ll discuss briefly the slow and steady behaviour we find in mining stocks with some Canadian examples; such as $FM.TO and $IAG. 

Briefly put, the mining industry in Africa has been bolstered from growth due to the regime of state-imposed regulation, often times riddled with corrupt practices such as preferential divvying of land allotments (see IAMs failures of expanding their base beyond South African region lines). But more recently, a new head of the WTO was instated- and simply put, **Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala** is an extreme opportunist when it comes to opening Africa for business. You can view her many TED talks regarding this, but in short she believes the only way to develop Africa is through cultivating a business culture. 

I have reason to believe that as head of WTO, she’s going to do just that- bolster the current constraints against business expansion throughout Africa through enacting more democratic, and toughly enforced accountability practices. This very obviously is good news to mining corporations, tack on her huge anti-corruption sentiments. Whereas the WTO had previously been very hands-off with industry in Africa in recent years, Ngozi is going to really address this.  

Furthermore, and in more recent news- she’s made her position on addressing COVID throughout the region very head on. It can be assumed that COVID has also played a contributing factor in bolstering growth of industry in Africa (see rapidly widening employment gaps throughout the region). This all points to very bullish sentiment in my opinion. 

Lastly, and this is an area where I could really use the help of this community to figure out- there have been growing sentiment towards investing directly in Gold futures as far as I have seen, and again- beneficial to the mining corps there.  

I’d love some help from you guys in picking some of the stocks that might see this growth I’m talking about, as once again- I’m not very well versed at interpreting the financial technicals of specific tickers. But this may be a good opportunity. TIA guys let’s find some gainful bois

My expectation is closer to  $5.1-$5.2B and EPS and $3+ for the Quarter.  Nvidia has topped revenue  estimates 10 of the last 12 quarters and beat profit estimates in 11 of  the last 12.   Demand remains high and the company has indicated their  gaming segment is already sold out through Q1.

The  blog below has an interesting take on the overlap of these two  companies.    It describes how NVIDIA’s technology covers every single  point in ARK Invest’s 2021 “Big Ideas” presentation.   I really doubt  there is another “disruptively innovating” company making such an impact  against their ""big ideas.""   Certainly ARK’s #1 holding TSLA, isn’t  anywhere near significant to their future as NVDA, let alone the others  rounding out their top 5: Square, Teledoc, Roku or Baidu.

The  mysterious part is NVDA is one of ARK’s smaller holdings.   All NVDA  shares in the three ARK funds they’re held in make up only 0.5% of all  assets in ARK’s actively managed funds.   Counter intuitive.

ARK  has started buying NVDA more prominently in late Dec.   With positive  earnings and a big fund acquiring looks like there could be plenty of  upside in NVDA.

So, I've been checking out all the telehealth companies, specifically AMWL, since they’ve been booming and I’m wondering if anyone has found anything different.

Here are the players I’m looking at right now: AMWL, TDOC, CVS, ANTM; with my primary focus being on AMWL. 

AMWL: Full disclosure, I’ve been heavily following them since their Q3 earnings call. Launched its IPO in Sept. 2020 where it was $18 and had a three month high of $42. Stock is currently trading just under $30, and IMO is highly undervalued. Results from Q3 show that the company had more than 1.4 million virtual visits, a 450% increase from the same period in 2019. Revenue from Q3 was $62.6 million, an 80% increase. From what I’ve been seeing, I'm expecting an increase from the Q4 results as well. I dug up some info, and it’s got an investment of $100 million from Google. Also a partnership with Cleveland Clinic, and a recently launched telepsychiatry service, so there must be something here with large interest from these companies. It’s still at an attainable price and my thoughts are, since the telehealth industry is booming, this looks like the next one to grow. 

TDOC: If you don’t know, TDOC had it’s IPO in July of 2015 at $19 a share and now hovers in the $280s. TDOC’s 5-year trend shows that telehealth stocks haven’t JUST been growing because of the pandemic. TDOC has been growing for years, with a 179% stock price increase between its IPO in 2015 and November of 2019. This could be because it was the main player for so long (founded in 2002) and the only health service looking to the future of technology in health for some time. Q4 earnings aren’t yet announced, as none of the others have announced either, but I don’t know if I should bother this late in the game to invest. Short-term signals are positive.

CVS: The company started trading under the ticker we all recognize in 1996, but CVS didn’t enter the telehealth market until 2018 through a partnership with the big guy above, TDOC. CVS saw a 600% increase in its MinuteClinic virtual visits from Q1 of 2019 to Q2 of 2020. It’s got a tumultuous history, so that’s probably why it’s currently undervalued. But is it going to keep growing? It seems extremely diverse as a pharmacy and it bought out Aetna a couple years ago, so now a healthcare provider as well. But it just fell, again, so is this still a solid stock? From what I’m reading, the long-term health of the stock is still trying to find a solid footing. 

ANTM: this is an independent licensee of BCBS and is the 5th largest publicly traded health benefits company in the US. Its origins go back to the 40’s as Mutual Hospital Insurance, Inc. After years of mergers and growth, it went public in 2001 and then expanded into the telehealth sphere in 2018. ANTM opened in Oct 2001 at $20.25. I’m reading that it looks like Q4 is going to have a below average return. I am seeing that some are saying that it may be undervalued but from what I’m reading the stock is in the middle of a falling trend in the short term. There are also expectations that it’s supposed to fall up to 5.57% more in the next few months. 

Some thoughts: TDOC is part of the EDOC ETF which recently launched last summer. Solid ETF choice that’s seen a 28% growth in the last 3 months. We see SO MUCH about ARKK, but I’m thinking EDOC is overlooked. My thoughts: getting into EDOC to mitigate risk, and investing individually in AMWL. 

TLDR: no brainer: telehealth is up, but I’m hyped on AMWL. Best-in-class technology stack, huge partner investments, incredible price upside, major revenue increases with what looks to be a positive Q4 earnings call. "|investing|I Want To Talk About Telehealth|202.0|0.93

I've always figured when you find a stock that you like for the long term, buy and hold.  Trying to find dips on which to buy just seems like you're going to be buying in at a higher and higher price over time compared to if you just bought now (assuming you were right about the stock in the first place).

Look at Bitcoin, for example.  It's down 10% today so if you like bitcoin, you should be ""buying the dip"" right now, right?  But if you like the investment, didn't you like it a week ago too?

*Before I begin, here is an anecdotal tidbit-If you haven’t seen some of the news recently, Israel, due to their response, has been recovering faster from COVID than most of the rest of the world. TEVA has helped them.*

**TL;DR:** TEVA $11 (World’s largest generic drug pharmaceutical manufacturer) has been significantly undervalued when compared to its big pharmaceutical competitors due to prior litigation. It has solid financial fundamentals, leveraging its debt appropriately, and has positive cash flow. I believe the market has significantly undervalued TEVA and it will eventually return to trading at similar levels to its peers (avg. $68pps).

**-First things first-Why the stock is suppressed:**

When you first pull up TEVA’s ticker, you will see that TEVA had been trading at $65 around 2016. From that point onward, there has been a precipitous drop off. Why you may ask? Well let me explain (or rather Wikipedia will explain)…

\-In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Teva of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.

\-In January 2019, the Supreme Court of the United States **decided for Teva** in Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

\-In May 2019, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA was one of 19 drug companies sued for price fixing in the United States by 44 states for inflating its prices, sometimes up to 1000%, in an illegal agreement among it and its competitors.Also in May 2019, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA agreed to pay $85 million to the U.S. state of Oklahoma to settle an opioid over prescription lawsuit.

\-In July 2019, Teva paid $69 million to settle pay-for-delay claims. (Thanks wikipedia)

The company has already earmarked funds for any final issues to shake out, the lawsuits have been settled, and the stock ticker is experiencing a drunken hangover from the party.

**Second things second-Why the stuck will not remain suppressed:**

For a financials perspective-check out Market Screener for their estimations. Your major objection will be their debt. Look at their payoff trends, they have been systematically paying off their debt, while also increasing their free cash flow. From a value perspective, the fundamentals are solid. If you don’t like their fundamentals, that is okay. However, Warren Buffett likes the stock, and while I’m not saying that erases objections, he is the quintessential value investor. He likes all of his 42.78 million shares.

Furthermore, check out this video on youtube-more specifically check out the 2:00 mark: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1e\_oDL1oqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1e_oDL1oqk)

Your first takeaway was probably that the CEO talks like a Diehard villain. You are right; he does and Bruce Willis is getting older…so that is a problem. **But your second thought is probably that TEVA was instrumental in the vaccine roll-out in Israel. The per capita chart speaks for its self.**

As of a few days ago, they have been in further talks with major pharma companies regarding TEVA assisting with vaccination production (Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-teva-pharm-ind-covid-exclusive/exclusive-teva-pharm-in-talks-to-co-produce-covid-19-vaccines-ceo-says-idUSKBN2AA20D](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-teva-pharm-ind-covid-exclusive/exclusive-teva-pharm-in-talks-to-co-produce-covid-19-vaccines-ceo-says-idUSKBN2AA20D))

Remember, TEVA is the world's largest generic drug manufacturer. If anyone is going to meet demand, it will be this company and, quite honestly, they probably need this good news story from a PR perspective.

Lets look at their competitors:

MERCK: $75

NOVARTIS: $89

ROCHE: $42

SANOFI: $47

MODERNA: $169

PFIZER: $34

TEVA: $10…they used to trade at the $60-70 range before the bad litigation (which they weathered and took appropriate financial responses).

Regression to the mean is real, especially when you start to move from the negative external market pressure events.

(As folks have commented, using share price as a comparison should not be a go-to for valuation, however, let me add this ""It is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a security of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity-provided that the buyer is informed and practices adequate diversification""-Benjamin Graham.  The price is low-hence the regression to the mean comment).

**Finally, the risk:** Yes, the CEO talks like a Diehard villain and, yes, the company has significant debt (which it is managing), and also some historical baggage. These are concerns; however, I believe that they have mitigated the risk by right sizing their organization, either winning their lawsuits/earmarking funds for settlements, and are systematically paying off their debt while growing their revenue.

**As stated, Warren Buffett and I believe this company-that you may not have been tracking-has significant upward potential, it has remained suppressed for a period of time due to litigation that has now subsided. The company has been right sizing, taking prudent financial decisions and is poised to return to its original trading position over the next two years.**

I'd be curious to hear your thoughts.

(Finally, some of y'all are serious people...I tried to inject humor with comments about Buffett, Diehard, et al. Sorry about that; I forgot we can't afford to laugh, rather we can only afford to make  money.)"|investing|TEVA-World's Largest Generic Pharma Producer|11.0|0.62

he almost bankrupted his hedge fund in the 2008 financial crisis because his timing was wrong. And no, plenty of people knew there was a bubble, he wasn't the first one.He got lucky at the end. Otherwise, nobody would knew him. There are people out there who had bet against the housing market and got bankrupt and we never hear about them, do we?

Second, he sold his g@mestop positions before it took off. He made profits, but small ones.

Third, he shorted Tesla lol.... we all know how this turned out. just coz it's overvalued doesnt mean you're right. being early = being wrong.

* **Market Close 02/19/2021: $12.33**
* **Market Cap 02/19/2021: $712.3 Million**
* **P/E 02/19/2021: 32.3**
* **Dividend/Yield 02/19/2021: 9.7%**

# Business Structuring

TCPC specializes in senior debt financing that works in lending to middle market and small businesses.  Working to make large returns on smaller companies, TCPC is structured as a BDC (Business Development Company) which by regulation requires the company to distribute more than 90% of its profits to shareholders.  This would be why the dividend is at **9.7%.**  

# Portfolio Allocation

The diversity in TCPC's portfolio is adequate:

&amp;#x200B;

|Industry|Percentage of Portfolio||
|:-|:-|:-|
|Internet and Software Services|12.7||
|Diversified Financial Services|11.6||
|Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods|6.3%||
|Software|6||
|Media|4.7||
|Diversified Consumer Services|4.7||
|Automobiles|4.5||
|Professional Services|4.5||
|Diversified Telecommunication Services|4||
|IT Services|3.4||
|Airlines|3||

The rest of the portfolio consists of investments of less than 3% which will be immaterial for this analysis.  

The internet and software service industry will continue to see growth as long as technology continues to improve and change.  With new technology becoming evermore present in this modern age, so will the need for servicing and replacing of that technology.  Top internet and software holdings:

* **Acquia 1%**
* **Domo 3%**
* **Foursquare Labs 2.5%**

The diversified financial services industry is a great allocation due to the wide range of possible investments.  It can also help keep ample float in the company for new investments, or provide the cash flow needed to pay out dividends to shareholders. Top diversified financial services holdings:

* **36th Street Capital Partners 2.5%**
* **Cetera 1%**
* **Cayman Islands 2%**

Textiles, apparel and luxury goods will stay popular among the more affluent consumer that wants to stay current with the fashion trend.  Holdings in the third quarter10-Q showed debt investments made to Kenneth Cole (1%), Eddie Bauer (3%) and Anne Klein (2%).  These companies operate with physical stores but with the majority of consumers now shopping online they bolster easy to navigate websites.  

The software industry will have prominence just as the internet and software service industry.  Technology has a fast dynamic and new software provides consumers with the best the market has to offer.  Top software holdings:

* **Certify 1.5%**
* **Snow Software 1.6%**
* **Syntellis Performance Solutions 1.3%**

The media industry has become increasingly competitive with so many being able to express their views online.  Top media holdings:

* **Lithium 1.6%**
* **NEP II 1.2%**

Diversified consumer services will show returns as the economy recovers and more consumers resume spending again.  The majority of the debt financed will be coming due at the end of 2021, and it has been a profitable industry of investment for TCPC.  Top diversified consumer services holdings:

* **Edmentum 3%**
* **Spark Networks 1.2%**

The automobile industry has been on the decline in recent years.  It has shown to be a loss for TCPC as an investment but can be reinvigorated with new electric vehicles gaining momentum.  Top automobile holdings:

# Long Term Investment

TCPC diversifies an investors portfolio while paying a large dividend that can be reinvested into the stock to provide for long term gains.  The investment horizon of this investment would be suggested at 5-10 years.  Younger investors may be have more risk tolerance for some of the investments made by TCPC.  A rule I have followed is only to buy stock in the company when it is below $10.  (The amount may change each quarter after review of financial statements)

I came across this company a few years ago while using it as an example in a class for high dividend paying stocks.  Since then I have purchased shares at times the market deems it to be worth less than book value and P/E is less than 30.  It has a solid balance sheet with a current ratio of over 2.  The cash flows look well with cash proceeds from operating activities of **$37.8 million** and cash used in financing activities of **$47.8 million.**  

Thank you for taking the time to review my analysis.  This is the first post I have made regarding the analysis of a stock so please leave a suggestion of how I can improve or what you thought was good material or what your perspective of this company is."|investing|Analysis of TCPC or BlackRock TCP Capital Corporation|6.0|0.7

How does the process of investing in a local business go? Can you just draft a contract as two consenting private entities given the business isn't large enough for the stake to be considered a security? Or is there some legal requirements in terms of drafting the contract? Say I want to buy a 20% stake in a local retailer for $10k, and we both agree to these terms, do I have to have our private contract overlooked by some 3rd party lawyer who has to verify its legitimacy? If we draft a contract as two private parties and I can verify with bank statements that I invested in the retailer but was misinformed or am somehow defrauded, can I take him to court?

Summary

Orladeyo now has regulatory approval for sale in the USA and Japan.
The Oral Factor D Phase 1 data is due to be published in the 1st quarter.
BioCryst announced $325 Million of funding from Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.
Baker Brothers and Sarrisa Capital now own 16% of BCRX.
The current short position is 31 million shares.
The Company
BioCryst (NASDAQ:BCRX) develops novel, oral and small molecules that inhibit enzymes playing a key role in biological pathways of rare diseases. Biocryst has built a world-class sales team to launch Orladeyo in the US and EU. Biocryst has signed a licensing agreement with Torii to launch the product in Japan. Management at Biocryst hired dozens of professionals with 10 plus years of rare disease sales experience, many of these salesmen came from Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) competitors. The vice-president and US general manager Allen Hodge was even responsible for the successful efforts of HAE drug launches of Cinryze and Firazyr, two pioneering injectable treatments for HAE. You could not get a more promising leader for this task. Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced a royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. This agreement gives BCRX $325,000,000 to launch Orladeyo in the USA and the EU.

Berotralstat Approval
With the US and Japanese approval of Berotralstat for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), BioCryst is in a position to finally cash in on 20-plus years of R&amp;D. Berotralstat (commercially called Orladeyo) is an oral, once-daily, small molecule kallikrein inhibitor positioned to capture a significant share of a $1.5 billion market. This market is expected to grow to $3.8 billion by 2025. This market is currently dominated by Takeda (NYSE:TAK) and CSL Behring LLC which offer preventive and rescue therapies.

These therapies require intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous administration which is highly invasive and time-consuming. The HAE market is clambering for an oral solution and Orladeyo is here to fill that void. The current solutions cost approximately $600k per year, and BioCryst is charging 485k per year for its daily oral pill. Orladeyo is a once-a-day pill given to patients with a terrible lifelong disease called Hereditary Angioedema. The available treatments for this disease are all IV drugs that are painful and produce local reactions.

Orladeyo is the first oral drug approved to treat this disease. On December 3rd, the US granted approval- very importantly with zero label statements- meaning that they had no concerns about side effects or dangers. On January 22nd, Japan granted approval. EU approval is expected imminently in the 2nd quarter of2021. In the US there are at least 10,000 people with HAE, yet only 7,500 are currently being treated.

There has been a peer-reviewed survey finding that 98% of IV prophylactic patients (the 7,500) would prefer an oral treatment and 96% of the non-prophylactic patients (the 2,500) would want an oral treatment. As it is shown on page 13th of the January 2021 Corporate Presentation (page 13), in their recently undergone survey, 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, with the number rising to 71% with Physician recommendation.


Japan had no approved treatment until Orladeyo was approved on January 22nd. The UK has awarded Orladeyo early access to the drug on November 9th. For further information on Orladeyo one should review this excellent piece written by Bio9999.

The Pipeline
Peramivir ™ (Rapivab)
Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration. Peramivir is a Bio-Defense drug that has been stockpiled by the government.

Galidesivir
This nucleotide RNA polymerase inhibitor disrupts the viral replication process and has the potential to treat multiple viral threats. NIAID is currently testing Galidesivir for treating Covid-19 and Yellow Fever. Galidesivir was safe and generally well-tolerated in a Phase 1 clinical human trial. Galidesivir demonstrated survival benefits in animal studies against a variety of serious pathogens, including: Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

Galidesivir demonstrated broad spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses of nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, toga viruses, bunya viruses, arenaviruses, and flaviviruses. Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential. Furthermore it is now known from the Phase I trial and the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe, showing dose-sensitive effects in people. BioCryst was awarded a 44 million dollar contract by BARDA to further study the feasibility of commercializing the drug.

FOP - BCX9250
FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren’t any approved treatments for this debilitating disease.

Oral Factor D
Oral Factor D could be the most valuable asset in BioCryst. According to author PitBullTrades in the report “BCRX the Embarrassment of Riches” BCX9930 is novel, oral, potent and a selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D currently in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.


The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

Staff excitement
Staff and team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals seem positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been conveyed in the recent conference calls where even typically humble staff such as the CEO Jon P. Stonehouse, or Vice President, William P. Sheridan would utter phrases such as: “Embarrassment of riches” or “We agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one”. “My only concern is I have no concerns, and that Oral Factor D is a pipeline in a molecule”.

Efficacy level
The key for efficacy with this kind of treatment is improving the number of Hb Hemoglobin levels. BCX9930 showed 3.8g/dL improvement (page 31). The competitor Novartis showed 2.87g/dL improvement and Alexion 2.4-2.6g/dL.


“In the study, BCX9930 was highly specific for the alternative pathway and, after oral dosing of BCX9930 in primates, alternative pathway activity was completely suppressed.”

“These data demonstrate that BCX9930 is a highly potent and specific orally bioavailable Factor D inhibitor with potential for treatment of patients with PNH and other alternative pathway mediated diseases,” said Dr. William Sheridan.

Alternative Pathway
What makes BCX9930 a game changer is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. With potential to treat up to 8 diseases currently, one understands why insiders call Oral Factor D a pipeline in a molecule. Here are the known diseases Oral factor D treats:


PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

Lupus Nephritis

IgAN vasculitis

C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $44.53B annually. That number is obtained by summing up the following:

""PNH Treatment Market Size Worth $5.8 Billion by 2025""

“""The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025""

“""aHUS, having in mind the disease prevalence (2 and 5.5)/MM, and the disease being treated with Soliris - 500,000$/ year. The worldwide market size should range between ( $7.5B and $20.5B)"" We take 7.5B as conservative.

“""Vasculitis treatment market size forecast to reach $743.2M by 2025""

“""IgAN, having in mind the 1/3,707 incidence rate, and the yearly cost of the drug $12,456 we are aiming for a market size of $4,660,088,544""

“Having in mind C3G can be treated with Soliris and it costs $500,000 a year. Summing up all those 45,700 patients the market size we aim for is 22.85B"". Lacking hype or a press release, the company started phase 2 BCX9930 study for PNH. The official page of clinical trials shows that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it validates our thoughts that Phase 1 data readout will be good and warrant further studies.

The Valuation
BCRX has 173 million shares outstanding and has a current price of $11.50 a share. This means BioCryst has a current market value of $1.9 billion. It is extremely hard to value an evolving drug pipeline, but I will try to give a conservative estimate.

Galidesivir
Galidesivir is an antiviral that is currently being funded and studied by BARDA. The purpose of this effort is for BARDA to find a broad-spectrum anti-viral to stockpile against possible bio attacks. The Government has awarded a total of $147 million to study this drug. Look at how many billions in market cap Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) gained with the Remdesivir approvals. Last quarter sales of Remdesivir were reported at $775 million. Roche Holding AG (OTCQX:RHHBY) just paid $350 million for US rights to AT-527, a potential Covid-19 antiviral from Atea Pharmaceuticals. Galidesivir could easily be worth $2-6 billion with the right approval.

Orladeyo
Orladeyo has US and Japanese approval, and was designated UK early access. Being the only oral treatment for PNH, Orladeyo could easily gain 30-70 percent market share of a current $1.5 billion market. This market is anticipated to grow to $3.8 billion by 2025. Orladeyo could have sales of $300 million to $1 billion by 2023 and potentially $2 to $4 billion by 2025. Based on these sales BCRX easily garner a multiple of 7-10 times sales. This would be $3 billion on the low side to $20 billion on the high side.

BCX9930 Oral Factor D
BCX9930 is potentially the most valuable asset in BioCryst's pipeline. BCX9930 has Orphan Drug and fast-track approval for PNH.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALXN) and Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN) have announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for Alexion to acquire Achillion, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule Factor D inhibitors to treat people with complement alternative pathway-mediated rare diseases, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). ALXN acquired ACHN for $930 million.


It can be credibly argued BioCryst's phase 1 data is better than the data from Alexion's phase 2 studies.

Developing a successful Oral D Factor drug will create revenue in eight or nine very valuable markets. For additional insights please see BioCryst's presentation on BCX9930.

If ACHN in early Oral Factor D drug development was acquired for $930 million, BioCryst's better results must be worth at least $3 billion right now and potentially worth $40 billion or more in 2025.

This pipeline is easily worth $10 billion and with further development could be worth north of $50 billion. BCRX has a current market cap of $1.9 billion.

Conclusion
The BCRX story has caught fire in social media, and could potentially see a rapid rise in share price if the short sellers are forced to cover. It is one thing to short 20% of the float in a biotech stock hemorrhaging money, but it is kamikaze insane to be caught in this position with BCRX. BioCryst is within a quarter of potentially producing hundreds of millions in yearly revenues. Institutions have quietly acquired over 90 percent of all the shares outstanding in BCRX, leaving an actual float, outside of institutional holdings, of 17 million shares at the most.

Say the institutions believe the stock is worth 50 or 60 dollars a share, at what price do the shorts find 30 million shares to cover this position? With one blockbuster drug approved and enough money to start multiple fast-tracked trials on a second- BCRX looks increasingly poised to be a buyout candidate. If Oral Factor D proves to be the holy grail the company believes it is, you could easily be looking at a 100 dollar stock in the future.

**SUMMARY**

Lululemon is a highly profitable company with above-average margins, a strong balance sheet, and a clear growth plan. The loyalty of their customer base is driving their growth, and it provides a moat (albeit a weak one) against competitors. LULU remains the clear market leader, with brands like Nike, Under Armour, and Victoria’s Secret Sport struggling to take market share.

However, nothing in today’s market is cheap. Execution and growth come at a price, and in LULU’s case, that price is 38.6x LTM EBITDA, 11.6x LTM Sales, or 83.4x LTM Earnings. LULU’s clothes are not cheap, and neither is their stock.

However, I believe in paying for quality, and LULU is a Company that is executing its growth plan quite effectively. Continued success has the potential to lead to further upside in the stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATES TO POWER OF THREE PLAN**

Management outlined a 5-year growth plan in 2018 called ‘Power of Three’. This plan outlined three primary goals for the next 5 years: Double revenue from men’s offerings, double revenue from digital channels, and quadruple international revenue.

Let’s take a look at each goal:

***Double Men’s***

The goal was to double revenue from men’s products from \~$700m when the goal was set (FY 2018) to \~$1.4bn by 2023. As of Q3 2020, LULU earned $900m in revenue from men’s products on an LTM basis. This means they are \~65% of the way towards that goal.

&amp;#x200B;

***Double Digital***

The goal was to double revenue from digital channels from \~$860m in FY 2018 to \~$1.7bn by 2023. Unsurprisingly, COVID helped this goal quite a bit. By Q3 2020, LULU earned &gt;$1.8bn from digital channels, well ahead of the goal.

***Quadruple International***

The goal was to quadruple revenue from international sources from \~$360m in FY 2018 to \~$1.4bn by 2023. LULU earned \~$560m in LTM (Q3 2020). This is on-pace with the current goal, but not as far ahead as the other two. It is worth noting that there were 34 stores open in Asia when this goal was set, and there are now 70 open (with plans to open more). So, the focus and energy are there, it is just taking time.

&amp;#x200B;

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

**DEBT**

$0 in debt\*.

*\*Due to an accounting change (ASC 842 issued by FASB), leases are now held on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes leases as a liability while recognizing an offsetting ‘Right of Use’ asset. As such, the Company technically has long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.*

&amp;#x200B;

**MARGINS**

LULU has impressive margins, especially for a retailer. Gross margins in the mid-50s, and a mid-teens net income margin.

&amp;#x200B;

||2017|2018|2019|LTM (Q3 '20)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Gross Margin|53.1%|55.2%|55.9%|55.6%|
|EBITDA Margin|22.7%|25.1%|26.5%|24.0%|
|Net Income Margin|9.8%|14.7%|16.2%|13.7%|

&amp;#x200B;

**RETURNS**

LULU has generated an attractive return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) for investors historically. While past performance is not indicative of future results (it never is), these figures have stayed consistently attractive over the years. Management has clearly been able to find good investment opportunities to deploy capital towards.

||2017|2018|2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ROA|14.2%|23.7%|24.1%|
|ROE|17.5%|31.8%|38.0%|

&amp;#x200B;

**CAPEX**

Even as the number of stores has gone from \~137 in 2010 (this only includes LULU-branded stores) to 515 in Q3 2020, the CapEx to fund these stores has come out of existing cash flow. CapEx as a percent of revenue has consistently stayed in the range of 7% and using Bruce Greenwald’s formula we can estimate that \~1/3rd of the total CapEx is maintenance CapEx, with the rest funding growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**BUYBACKS**

LULU generates enough cash flow to fund growth CapEx while also funding a share buyback program. Since the program was first announced in 2013, LULU has purchased \~$1.5bn of shares, reducing the diluted share count by \~10% from 146m to 130m.

As of Q3 2020, the Board has authorized an additional $500m in share buybacks. Share buybacks are a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders while allowing more flexibility than a traditional dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

**MIRROR**

LULU purchased MIRROR, an at-home interactive fitness product, in mid-2020. Management guided analysts to expect a 2020 revenue contribution of $100m. This figure was raised towards the end of last year to $150m. MIRROR, like Peloton, will benefit from the increasing interest in at-home fitness products. MIRROR diversifies LULU’s revenue stream while giving the Company the chance to market directly to LULU customers in their living rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

**COMPS**

Compared to comps, LULU is quite expensive. My comps group includes the companies listed at the bottom of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

||EV / Revenue|EV / EBITDA|EV / EBIT|P/E|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**LULU**|**10.9x**|**45.5x**|**55.8x**|**79.5x**|
|Median|2.7x|15.3x|56.2x|79.5x|
|Mean|3.6x|19.4x|81.7x|78.9x|

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

As I mentioned in the beginning, LULU is not cheap. This isn’t an undervalued opportunity. Instead, this is an excellent company that is hitting (and exceeding) its growth targets. It’s impossible to know what will happen to multiples or the stock price, but LULU appears to be a strong company that I would like to own (and, full disclosure, I do!).

* Covid vaccine general population availability in the US is expected late April, Early May.  ([Link](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/11/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html))
* Early covid vaccinations are hitting the most at-risk communities first, addressing the strongest population for hospitalizations and other major medical events, which tend to play a major factor in setting policy (covid-based restrictions).
* A large portion of the populous has put off dating for quite a while and are ready to get back to dating. ([Link](https://nypost.com/2021/02/14/dating-apps-sees-surge-of-users-boasting-about-being-vaccinated/))
* Many businesses tied to dating were closed over the past 10-12 months, and are reopening currently in limited capacity, or in the near future. This includes restaurants, movie theaters, amusement parks, breweries, bars, etc.

Looking at the two big available options:

* MTCH - Match Group Inc (Match, Tinder, etc): $160 current, 1 year ago $70
* BMBL - Bumble Inc. (Bumble): IPO in 2021, IPO Price $43, current $70

General thoughts? Haven't begun to dig into any of the details on the two companies yet. Just starting considering this today.

&gt;Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.

The investments I have in mind are those of Cathie Wood with ARK Genetic in particular since its success relies on bipartisan/international efforts across a variety of topics/issues(e.g Religion, Eugenic/Ethics, Healthcare, Privacy, Cybersecurity, Science skeptics) in addition to the fact that this is a matter of life and death and as such will face extreme scrutiny and red tape. This is yet to include issues when dealing with Mother Nature that we cannot currently comprehend or imagine. 

Just my opinion, but something like defy/delay aging and diseases just sounds so much more futuristic than say flying cars or human-like robot caretakers. Moreover, if genomics actually progress as fast and as good as Ark predicts, there will be plenty of new industries or services being created to accommodate healthier/longer-living humans thus there is no needs to risk investing in Genomic."|investing|Unknown unknowns in thematic ETFs/industries that market overlooks/overly optimistic|9.0|0.66

Theoretically how low can you reduce your cost basis by selling covered calls?   If you sold weeklys and reduced your cost basis by .20 a week, is it possible to reduce your cost basis far beyond the current selling price; provided it trades side ways for an extended period of time?

Would a better strategy be to average down as much as one could first and then sell covered calls?

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* **Wide base of operation** \- The company is operates in multiple countries. It has operational units in Canada, France, South Africa, Spain, South Africa and the USA with a further presence in Argentina, China and Venezuela. This wide base of operations means that Ferroglobe has clients worldwide which may protect the company from localised changes in demand.
* **Largest producer of silicon metal in the EU and North America** \- Silicon is becoming increasingly important in our economy as it is used in a wide variety of products such as electronic semi-conductors. Silicons demand is not supported wholly by the available supply. Some evidence of this is that recently a silicon chip shortage caused automakers such as Ford and General Motors have had to idle their some of their factories. (more information at [https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/a-silicon-chip-shortage-is-causing-automakers-to-idle-their-factories/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/a-silicon-chip-shortage-is-causing-automakers-to-idle-their-factories/))
* **US focus** \- China is currently the world's largest supplier of silicon. Increasing tensions between the US and China could work to Ferroglobe's advantage. Recently a group of US chip companies sent a letter to President Biden urging him to provide 'substantial funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing'. Some signatories included Intel and AMD. (Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2AB11H](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2AB11H)) Ferroglobe may be a beneficiary of any actions resulting from this.
* **Tariff action** \- Recently it was ruled that Silicon was being dumped in the US by Malaysia and Kazakhstan. This allows the US to place tariffs on imports from these countries as per the GATT Article 6 which allows countries to take action against dumping. This should remove competition for Ferroglobe.

Weaknesses:

* **Debt problems** \- Recently Ferroglobe was downgraded to C by Fitch. This downgrade was following a USD 350 million refinancing plan which was treated as a distressed debt exchange. The refinancing includes an extension of note maturity to 2025 from 2022. Fitch believes that this action was taken as the Ferroglobe's only option to avoid bankruptcy or insolvency. Ferroglobe has also decided to withdraw from the Fitch rating system. This means that the company will now no longer receive a rating or analytical coverage from Fitch.
* **Negative trend in earnings** \- There has been a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. The consensus estimate has trended lower, going from a loss of 52 per share to its current level of a loss of 59 cents per share.

Opportunities:

* **The importance of silicon in technology** \- Silicon has been showing potential to be in its involvement of Li-ion batteries, which are absolutely critical in attempting to solve climate change. This is particularly prevalent in the automotive sector where it is thought that battery electric vehicles are best placed to reduce the sectors emissions. It may be a case of selling spades to gold diggers, in that in the EV mania key suppliers of companies such as Tesla and others may be a great play.

Threats:

* **Competitors** \- There are many solid companies in the mining and materials industry. If silicon is proved to be as profitable and necessary as its potential then Ferroglobe, while having a first mover advantage, may be out performed by better structured, more established players such as Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) or BHP group (BHP)
* **Debt issues** \- the company has a significant amount of debt. It has issued USD 350,000,000 worth of bonds and has taken USD 400,000,000 as loans. The company still has all of the USD 350,000,000 of bonds outstanding, as part of the refinancing deal. This could be seen as an opportunity as it allows the company to pay these off and begin to move forward, however this fiscal year the company has had revenue growth of -27.96% which is obviously concerning whether it was because of COVID-19 or not due to the amount of outstanding debts that the company owes. It should be noted that in the fiscal year Ferroglobe did have a revenue growth of 29.43% which maybe an indicator that the underlying business model is strong.

# Analysts thoughts

Looking in Yahoo finance it shows that the Recommendation trends of the stock are generally positive. The stock has multiple buy and strong buy recommendations, although the Recommendation rating is currently hold. I will attach a screenshot for further viewing.

TLDR

The company operates in mining. Great potential in terms of commodities such as silicon which is used in Microchips and Li-ion batteries (used in EVs!!). There are some concerns with the company such as debt and being maybe less established in the industry when compared to some competitors.

If you've been following OPY over the past two weeks since my first thread, you might be wondering -- not much has changed, so why make this post?

Well gents, I got in touch with the CFO, Jeffrey Alfano, to ask him why Oppenheimer's (OPY) stock price seemed to be so low. I called him on Friday, and here's the kicker: Mr. Alfano told me that he gets calls like this *all the time.* Apparently a fair number of people don't quite understand why the company appears undervalued.

For a quick recap, the stock/company...

* Just had its most profitable year ever
* This year's EPS were almost 2x its second-most profitable year ever
* Has a P/E ratio of around 4.00
* Has been undergoing growth YoY every year since 2016
* Has been conducting share buybacks (float is down more than 4% from 2019)
* Has a tangible book value per share of 41.31 -- 11.8% higher than its current share price
* Has a lower share price than in **2007**, when...
   * its tangible book value per share was only **12.30,** and
   * its EPS then was almost **half** its current EPS (despite 2007 being -- apart from 2020 -- its most profitable year)

So why is OPY seemingly still so undervalued? The good news is that I don't really have a good answer! But I do have *some* answers. Below I will relay some of the information Mr. Alfano gave me -- and some conclusions I've arrived at myself -- about *why* the stock price may be trading lower compared to some of its competitors.

In this post, I'll be going into detail about:

* current and past risks (real and perceived) to the stock and its pricing
* why Q4 2020 was such a blow-out quarter
* appropriate valuation of the company

**Current and past risks to the company**

**1. CEO has total ownership of the company**

The first thing Mr. Alfano discussed was the corporate structure of the company. This is actually mentioned as one of the risk factors in the 10-K. Essentially, all publically-traded shares in the company are non-voting shares. This isn't an inherently a bad thing -- Chinese ADRs function the same way, and so do, essentially, any other company in which one person has a controlling stake of 51%. And yet, these other companies trade at often lofty valuations. In OPY, the CEO, Albert G. Lowenthal, owns something like 98% of the voting shares. Mr. Lowenthal's son, Robert S. Lowenthal, is a senior managing director for the company. A fair assumption would be that Robert is poised to assume leadership of the company when his father retires, though this was never actually indicated to me or even hinted at.

I must stress: Mr. Alfano doesn't personally perceive this as an inherently negative. He seems to have a great respect and admiration for Mr. Lowenthal. He characterized Mr. Lowenthal as being very engaged, studious, hard-working, and very present in the office. And he also mentioned that under his son's leadership, the company has seen record growth. If I believed his convictions to be anything less than genuine, I wouldn't have included them in this follow-up. Still, some investors might view the lack of voting shares as disincentive for owning the stock. This was the first reason Mr. Alfano indicated for why the stock might be trading so low.

**2. Past risks**

OPY apparently ran into some regulatory issues in the past, which could still affect public perception of the stock and company today. I don't know much about these issues, so I suggest you do your own DD. The impression I got was that these issues are in the past and the company has moved past them.

1. Auction rate issues in 2012 -- posed a massive issue for the firm as it was coming out of the financial crisis. Clients had 2.8 billion in assets when the auction markets froze and the auction rate dragged. I... I really don't know anything about this at all. Would appreciate if anyone more knowledgeable than me can chip in.
2. Penny stock regulatory issues in 2015-2016. Mr. Alfano didn't go into detail about this, and I didn't press him on it. It's likely that you can observe the breadth of this [here](https://www.businesstrialgroup.com/news/should-you-trust-your-financial-adviser/). Following 2016, the company has turned around and established a consistent track record of improving earnings.

**3. Potentiality for capital &amp; corporate tax increases**

Mr. Alfano didn't initially bring this one up, but responded in detail when prompted. He said that some clients could've completed more trades in Nov/Dec in anticipation of increased capital gains taxation under a Democratic Congress and White House, *maybe,* and this could've contributed to the massive earnings beat in Q4. This seemed like an extremely minor consideration IMO, but he made time to discuss it briefly, so I figured I would as well.

More significant would be the likelihood of an increase in corporate taxes. My specialty isn't US tax law, so bear with me. I copied down the numbers as I heard them, but I don't know how much more detail I could go into. Before 2017, the effective tax rate for OPY was 40-42%, and now it's been cut to 27-30%. This corresponds to roughly a 21% corporate marginal tax rate. The Biden admin is proposing raising this rate to 28%, which ought to be factored into any calculations of OPY's future earnings and valuation. As an example, this means that OPY's post-tax earnings in 2020 would be down from 122,986m to 111,540m.

**4. Effect of interest rate changes (negative or positive)**

With greater talk of interest rates turning negative, it's worth considering the effect this would have on OPY's profitability. Lower interest rates *are* identified as a risk factor in OPY's 10-K. Were interest rates to decline further, OPY's earnings from its bank deposit cash sweep program (which makes up about 10% of their total revenue) would be adversely affected. Still, when interest rates decline, the loss the company incurs is made up elsewhere. I mentioned this in my last post briefly -- in this time of historically low interest rates, OPY has had its best earnings ever. So while there is some cyclicality to the company's earnings, there are some counter-cyclical aspects as well. Mr. Alfano didn't wish to comment on any prediction for negative interest rates. However, an increase in interest rates would likely benefit the company greatly. The financial sector as a whole is likely to be severely undervalued in the case that interest rates *do* increase as the economy starts to reopen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why was Q4 such a blowout quarter?**

If you followed my last post, you might be wondering why Q4 2020 earnings were so high compared to the other quarters. I didn't have an answer then, but I do now, and it's quite simple. OPY's Q4 is usually its biggest quarter. Mergers and acquisitions, as well as equity underwriting, performs well in Q4 as companies try to close deals before the end of the year. The equity underwriting market this year was very profitable for OPY (as I hypothesized in my previous post), and these exceptional earnings simply continue a sustained track record of growth over the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Appropriate valuation of the company**

Previously, I'd used EPS as a metric to assert that OPY was incredibly undervalued. It seemed ludicrous to me that a financials company could trade at just 4x its current earnings per share, especially after 4 consecutive years of unprecedented growth, low debt, share buybacks, etc., etc.

However, it appears now that I was using a metric that I *believed* *to* reflect the stock's appropriate valuation. Instead, we must look at history to identify and establish a trend of how the market as a *whole* assigns value to OPY.

For over two years -- from Dec 2017 to Feb 2020 -- the stock traded flat. This is despite 2018 earnings increasing from 2.05 EPS to 3.82 EPS. So what gives? When reviewing this period, it seems like the stock's price to tangible book value (PTBV) more accurately reflects the stock's movements.

The PTBV is a measurement that involves the net value of all the company's tangible assets. In other words, if you were to liquidate everything in the company, the PTBV would reflect how much money you would have left per share. If the ratio is 1.00, that means that the company's current stock price reflects the intrinsic value of a company. If the ratio is 2.00, that means that the company is priced 2x above its current inherent value. Sometimes the ratio can be *below* 1. This usually applies to the stocks of cyclical companies -- companies that are earning good *now*, but may have a storm to weather and losses to expect in the near future.

Since 2017, OPY has had a history of trading at *lower* than its PTBV, despite not really being in the same vein as cyclicals like semiconductors, luxury, and travel. Observe some very rough numbers, based on EOY stock price:

||2020|2019|2018|2017|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tangible book value per share|41.31|33.03|28.78|26.74|
|Stock price at EOY|37.10|27.84|25.41|26.80|
|PTBV|0.90|0.84|0.88|1.00|

The stock is currently trading below the actual tangible assets of the company! That means that if they were to liquidate everything in the company *this very moment*, they would, theoretically, have more cash per share than the actual share price of the company. I personally find this ludicrous, but what can you do? This valuation is consistent with patterns of previous years.

In my last post, I analyzed some large and small cap competitors of OPY. Mr. Alfano indicated two good competitors to use when doing a comparative analysis, so I thought I would conduct a short comparative analysis of their financials here. It's worth mentioning that these companies are not small cap, unlike OPY. Just for fun, I've also included what OPY's share price would be if its P/E ratio and PTBV were comparable to those of two of its competitors:

||OPY ^((from Dec 10-K))|RJF ^((from Sept 10-K))|SF ^((from Dec 10-K))|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Share price|36.95|118.25|59.16|
|EPS|9.27|6.17|3.68|
|P/E ratio|3.97|19.18|14.23|
|OPY's share price at the same P/E ratio|36.95|178.51|132.44|
|TBVPS|41.31|34.99|12.79|
|PTBV|0.90|3.38|4.62|
|OPY's share price at same PTBV ratio|36.95|138.77|189.68|

So, you can see that OPY is undervalued on basis of:

* P/E ratio (historical)
* P/E ratio compared to competitors
* PTBV compared to competitors

However, if we *only* look at OPY's PTBV since 2016, the stock seems to be trading in its normal and expected range. This one independent variable certainly isn't an ideal metric for valuing the stock, but then again, I don't think any of us would claim the current stock market is rational.

You'll have to determine the better valuation metrics for the stock:

* a track record of growth
* low P/E ratio compared to previous years
* low PTBV compared to competitors

or...

* an established history of years of trading below a 1.00 PTBV

&amp;#x200B;

Remember: what *should* happen isn't always what *will* happen in the stock market. It's admittedly frustrating watching meme companies with a market cap of 4 billion and negative earnings of 2 million run up 30% in one day, day after day. OPY traded flat for over a year despite nearly doubling its EPS. Just because the stock may be undervalued does not mean that the market will realize this and start to price in a more realistic and less pessimistic valuation for the stock. It's important to keep that in mind. Nonetheless, I know where my convictions lay.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr**: Is OPY extremely undervalued? IMO yes. Could the market continue to undervalue it for years, and the stock remain stagnant? Yes. Could the market suddenly decide to price it more fairly, causing the price to rise drastically and suddenly? Also yes. This could be a very slow burn.

In December 2018, Cronos Group Inc. [Announced C$2.4 Billion Strategic Investment](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cronos-group-inc-announces-c2-4-billion-strategic-investment-from-altria-group-inc-300761820.html) from Altria Group, Inc.

Altria Group bought a 45 percent stake in leading cannabinoid company Cronos Group for about $1.8 billion.

Altria **also** has a warrant that would allow it to increase its stake in Cronos to about 55 percent at a price of $19 per share. It allows Cronos the flexibility to take investments from other companies such as, for example, a big food company. 

&gt;""The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumer,"" Cronos CEO Mike Gorenstein said.

Its established U.S. presence should, therefore, serve to benefit Cronos, when cannabis is legalized federally. I suspect majority ownership will come into effect within the next 6-8 months. 

&gt;""most important aspect of growth is going to be innovation and R&amp;D; The proceeds from Altria's investment will enable us to more quickly expand our global infrastructure and distribution footprint, while also increasing investments in R&amp;D and brands that resonate with our consumers. Importantly, Altria shares our vision of driving long-term value through innovation **(technology)**, and we look forward to continuing to differentiate in this area. As one of the largest holding companies in the adult consumer products sector, Altria has decades of experience in regulatory, government affairs, compliance, product development and brand management that we expect to leverage, particularly as new markets for cannabis open around the world.""

&amp;#x200B;

I've created a spreadsheet with a column (Q) in which I have drop down lists for the 11 possible sectors.  I'd like to create a pie chart using the results, but need a formula for the raw data.

For each of the items chosen in column Q, I want the formula to look in column I and create a total.

If column Q has Information Technology selected in a cell, I want the formula to look in the same row and return the value in column I which is a percentage.  If it were that straightforward, that would be easy, but multiple cells in column Q will have the same value (Information Technology, or Consumer Staples, or one of the other 9 possible choices), so I need it to search for all of column Q and the corresponding items in column I so I get a total.

The end result, should give me a list in another tab that looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Communication Services|0|
|:-|:-|
|Consumer Discretionary|12.1|
|Consumer Staples|5.49|
|Energy|0|

and so on

In this example, Information Technology would be a sum of 3 different stocks (so it needs to add the value of each of those equivalent columns I (27.13%, 46.46%, and 8.5%).

From there, I can make a dynamic pie chart on my main tab such that any time I buy or sell stocks in each sector, the value in column I changes and my pie slices change accordingly.

1613893366.0|0.0|t3_lorzlt|7.0|"Empower - $CBDT(CSE) or $EPWCF (OTC) experienced a phenomenal 196% gain in the past 5 trading days. Congratulations to those who held, and welcome to any new investors to take a deep dive. There is still room for growth. 

One must wonder.. when money goes into a company, valuation goes up. At what valuation would CBDT be considered just right? This is all my personal opinion and I just want to share my due diligence with everyone. I am not asking anyone to buy or sell. My information may not always be correct so make sure you do your DD as well. 

There are approximately 295,000,000 shares issued and 56,000,000 in reserve. Lets just say there is 350,000,000 shares total to make the math easier. The past Friday, Cbdt closed at 1.69 representing a market cap of 350,000,000x1.69=591,500,000. That is a pretty hefty market cap considering their Q3 2020 results show revenues of only 630,000 from their health clinics... BUT WAIT.. Q4 is where it starts getting interesting. On October 6th, empower acquired Kai Medical Labs (follow them on instagram) a state of the art laboratory for testing and R&amp;D. 

Lets talk more about Kai Medical Labs. Their CEO is Yoshi Tyler. For those that didnt know (which is a lot of u) is that she worked at pfizer for many years. Yes the same pfizer that makes the covid vaccine. To me, she had insight on how covid is effecting us on a mass scale and saw the need to test people. 
Some of the tests they offer include covid, hematology, toxicology, hormone, and vitamin testing. It is their covid testing segment that is blowing up. According to Steven, who is CEO of Empower Clinics, the amount of tests processed in October was doubled in November, and then tripled in December (triple of october that is.) Q4 goes from October to December so this directly impacts the revenues. Sounds good right? But wait.. theres more. They are under going an expansion that is 3x the current size to accommodate the expected “thousands of tests” that are to be coming. A portion of the expansion will also be used for logistics.. (this must be super complicated considering test volume.) Kai Labs has recently achieved a milestone of 1000 tests in a single day. Each test costs 150$ from my knowledge but i have seem this number as low as 100 and as high as 220. I remember hearing steve mention they are approximately 150$ direct to consumer. It is known that these test kits were shipped to Canada and given out as samples to gain potential contracts. 

Lets do some math here shall we. If they can average 900 tests per day at 150$ per test for 365 days straight, that would yield a total of 49,000,000 in revenue annually. Keep in mind that this is only their covid test. There is also revenue from other tests. Ok lets say 50,000,000 revenue annually from Kai Labs at 900 tests a day. (FYI they are expecting it to grow to THOUSANDS A DAY) so my numbers are extremely low estimates. 

Before I continue onto their clinic portion, lets talk about their covid test kit. kai Labs offers SALIVA COVID PCR TEST KITS! They have 99% accuracy and can determine UK and South African variants of covid. The test kit is FDA EUA Ce marked and MDEL approved. From my understanding, MDEL also equals health Canada approval. Empower Clinics obtained MDEL status for their Kai Lab saliva test kit via MediPro whos CEO is Sheila Copps. If you dont know who she is, she was the Deputy Prime Minister to Jean Chretien who was the prime minister of Canada. This means.. GOVERNMENT CONNECTIONS. There is a good reason why she allowed Kai labs to piggy back off her MDEL license. This is all speculation that Empower may gain Canadian government contracts in the near future. I MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG. Kai Labs has also tested the US national team.. who knows who else they have partnerships with thats not news worthy. On top of all that, kai labs also sells a kit called KAI ABC that determines whether you have influenza A/B or covid. It must be good to know that you have influenza over covid.. Anyways, enough with Kai Labs. 

Lets talk about news on opening clinics. Theres 2 deals in place from my knowledge. 1 with doctor tsimerman/dr rabinowitz to open 30 clinics at an aggressive pace for share incentives, and 2, the deal with rexall to open 10 clinics. 

Lets talk about the deal with the 2 doctors. The share incentive deal includes 350,000$ upfront+ 250,000$ in shares between both of them.(dont know at what price per share) they have milestone incentives at opening 10 clinics, 20 clinics, and 30 clinics. Each milestone allows them to purchase 1,250,000 shares 

That a total of 3,750,000 shares. Now these shares are juicy right now due to the recent rise in price so i would assume these doctors would want to reach these milestones so they can purchase these incentive shares. I think they have 24 months do complete those milestones? Im not too sure. 

So lets say 10 clinics open this year. Each clinic brings in 150,000 per month x 12 months makes 1,800,000 revenue per clinic annually. 10 clinics means a whopping 18,000,000 annual revenue when q1 of 2022 starts but keep in mind, there are still 20 more clinics coming.  

Lets just say this portion brings in.. 18,000,000 annual revenue starting q1 of 2022 and will grow throughout the year. 

Ok now onto the rexall deal. They are supposedly opening 10 clinics that are connected to rexall pharmacies. Lets talk a bit about how big this is. Rexall is owned by a company called McKesson. Trading on the NYSE under ticker MCK. They have whopping 28 billion dollar market cap. (And they signed agreement with empower when empower market cap was a measly 200 million) they have 400 pharmacies throughout canada and presence in the US and Europe. McKesson is also in the top 100 contracted companies by the US. Even if Empower opened clinics at 10% of the 400 rexall pharmacies, thats still a whooping FOURTY clinics! (On a side note: Daryl Katz used to own Rexall. Daryl Katz is also the owner of the Edmomton Oilers. Not saying theres any deals in place but there is a connection to potential NHL covid testing contracts.) Back to rexall, lets assume these clinics yield slightly higher revenues at 20,000,000 annually for the 10 clinics. Lets assume it will take all of 2021 to build out these clinics, so come 2022 q1, thats an additional 20,000,000 in annual revenue. Steve expects revenues to hit 2,500,000 per location making a total annual revenue of 30,000,000. However, we will stick with our 20,000,000 revenue model. 

Keep in mind, they already have 6 Clinics thats pulling in annual revenue of approximately 2,400,000 annually. 

Man im using some under exceeding numbers.. here, but I rather be in for a surprise than be disappointed with the quarterly reports. 

Clinics yield 40,400,000 annually starting 2022 q1 and will continue to rise 2,000,000 annually per additional clinic opened. 

Kai labs yields 50,000,000 at only 900 tests a day not including other sorts of tests, I am expecting this number to increase SIGNIFICANTLY. 

Worst case scenario, by 2022 their revenue is 90,400,000 annually (and increasing)

I posted a write up today on comparing WELL.TO valuation to CBDT valuation, this info is actually on Empower investor package thing. 

WELL.TO has a trailing twelve month revenue of 40m. Their valuation is 1.4 billion dollars. So that means by 2022 empowers 90m annual revenue represents more than 2x of WELL.TO. Lets say because of the double in revenue compared to WELL.TO, valuation should go up as well. I think a 2 billion dollar market cap is fair if we were to compare numbers. 

As stated earlier, current valuation at 1.69/share represents approximately 600m market cap. In order to reach 2-2.4 billion market cap, that would require 3-4x the current share price. THREE TO FOUR TIMES. YES! So 1.69 x 4 = 6.76 by 2022.. 
I am just comparing numbers from 2 stocks. I have nothing against WELL.TO, I am just simply using their numbers as a guideline.

Fyi, there was an interview where 100,000,000 annual revenue from clinics was mentioned. (40 rexall clinics x 2,500,000 revenue annually per clinic = 100,000,000) Comparing that to my measely guess of 40,000,000 annual revenue from clinics is no where near the astronomical bar that was set by steve. 

Additional info: they have a RADT test submitted to health Canada awaiting approval. The partnership is with API Pharma and once HC approved, Empower will have Canadian distribution rights. They have agreements with simpliflying which allows us major potential to gain airline covid testing contracts. Another agreement with loop insights fo safely open up the Vancouver tourism industry. And additionally, kai labs is affiliated with testing Disney film production cast members and olympians on the US national team. 
——————————————————
Now lets move onto catalysts thats driving this stock to insane heights. There is a lot of chatter going on about press releases. I do not work for cbdt nor do I know anyone that is affiliated with empower clinics. These are all just potential news reports that might come out in the near future. 

A lot of people want to buy CBDT, but not every stock broker offers CSE companies. Not to worry, DTC eligibility is expected sometime this month. Up list to nasdaq will follow. The US market is 10x bigger. 

There are rumours of airline and/or cruise line contracts abound. Steve specifically said hes in talks with air canada and west jet. 

There are rumours of airport contracts such as YVR and DFW. New laws in Canada begin Feb 22 for all air travel passengers. 

There should be news coming up soon on clinic expansion. I am expecting the next release to have solid information on the terms, location, etc. Whether it be with rexall or the 2 doctors. 

Awaiting API Pharma health canada approval for the 15 minute RADT test. 

Actively looking at Canadian lab partnerships and acquisitions. 

Sports leagues covid testing contracts

Sheila Copps and canadian government contracts and McKesson and united states government contracts. Possible potential there

Steve did mention Empower gained international attention.. so potential international collaboration? 

The biggest catalyst to me is the anticipation of 2020 Q4 results. This will really show how MASSIVE the kai lab acquisition really is. (I am expecting revenues to grow RAPIDLY throughout 2021) 
———————————————————
Interviews with steven mcauley can be found with wallstreetreporter, canadian stockman, proactiv, and agoracom. I personally use barchart to look up past news releases. 

So my opinion now. People say this is not a covid stock. This is.. and it isnt.. but both sides compliment each other. Covid is here to stay. Vaccines allow you a better chance to fight off covid but that by no means means you cannot catch covid. Vaccinations will take years to perfect... but hold on.. covid strains are mutating into different variants. Seems like we’ll never catch up with the vaccines now. Therefore, these covid PCR Saliva tests will be the gold standard and start bringing in huge revenues for the foreseeable future. Also, who would want a Qtip shoved up their nose numerous times... I personally would rather spit into a test vial. Covid testing may one day even become a standard of life. Dont hate, this is just a potential outcome. Now the clinics are opened as “health clinics” meaning people will be going there to get tested for covid. Empower has their own covid test kit meaning they would be make more revenue than selling someone elses kit. Worse comes to worse.. err best.. covid is cured! That means Kai labs revenue will decrease, however as mentioned above, they also offer numerous other tests and also has an R&amp;D team capable of extraordinary things like detecting specific covid variants.. im just saying..but 30 clinics + 40 rexall clinics + 6 original clinics = 76 clinics. 76 x 2,500,000 (steves number for annual revenue per clinic) = 190,000,000. So it seems like from any perspective you look at.. the numbers are indicating this company is going to become a MONSTER. I believe in Steves ability to execute execute and execute. did I mention execute? 

If you made it to the end, thank you. I hope you enjoyed my personal opinion on this company. I strongly believe i set the revenue bar super low and it still reveals that this company is undervalued. However, we need to see the next couple quarterly reports to get a better sense of direction. I welcome any new investors! And there is nothing wrong with taking profits. Now go do your DD before you buy. I will be adding shares every time share price consolidates. This stock will have me set for the future. REMEMBER, potential 4x of CURRENT SHARE PRICE!

Something that I don't see being discussed very often is the matter of Financial Fidelity. For this discussion, I will definine it as ""The degree of responsibility and transparency/honesty which an individual has towards combined finances, which he or she accumulates and invests with a partner/SO"".

Financial infidelity would be to operate these shared finances without consulting the partner, possibly to act in an irresponsible and/or selfish manner, often followed by lies and deception to prevent the partner from discovering the infidelity and its effects on the combined finances (which I will call ""Couple Savings"" from now on)

I'm not in a relationship, but my attention was drawn to this matter as the current events related to certain volatile stocks produced terrible outcomes. Among these, I was particularly shocked by the amount of people who took large ammounts of money from their Couple Savings (without the other partner's consent or even their awareness ) to gamble on these stocks, and were met with crushing losses. Posts were either written by the ones breaking the trust and who were now desperate at the inevitable need to explain what happened to the SO, or the SO her/himself describing their panic at discovery.

I noticed that most of the infidelity cases I've read were caused by male partners, breaking female partner's trust. Men seem to believe they have a better grasp on finances and money than their Girlfriends/Wives, and think they have no need to talk with them before making financial decisions. They appear to see themselves as capable of making a genius move to surprise their SOs with absurds amounts of money and expensive gifts. Perhaps a good intention corrupted by an inflated ego. I have witnessed a similar culture on my own family, where men tend to believe that they know how to make and invest money while the women don't. The funny thing is that, if they heard their wives advice, they would have avoided most of their worst losses. The results is that some of the woman decide, rightly so, to keep some of their earnings from their husbands, and protect it from the stupidity of their partners. Because of this, I believe that financial infidelity should be a very important risk for woman to consider in relationships.

Thinking about this, what are the strategies which you use or plan to use when consolidating a relationship, in order to create Couple Savings while also protecting your own wealth as an individual? Which rules do you consider essential when dealing with shared finances and investments? Do you even consider Shared Finances necessary? If not, why?"|investing|The matter of financial fidelity and shared savings/investments|9.0|0.72

&gt; Roughly 20% of new Bitcoin is mined in Xinjiang, the site of some of the world’s most egregious human-rights abuses.
Today, Bitcoin’s association with Xinjiang is barely discussed. But that may change. For public-facing funds considering investing in the notoriously volatile asset, there are two other risks to consider. The first is that because of the concern among the American public about human-rights abuses in Xinjiang, holding assets tied to the region comes at the risk of a public relations disaster.

I read the book ""Understanding Options"" 2E by Michael Sincere and am re-reading the book ""The Intelligent Options Investor"" by Erik Kobayashi-Solomon. Even though the former book is directed at speculating in options it did a good job at explaining the fundamentals of options and the various techniques and strategies, as well as the Greeks. I agree with the notion of Erik's book more since I think it is directed to an actual investment framework. I very much enjoyed the first hald of the book but I have to say that it is harder for me to follow along with Erik's books as his writing is not as clear as Michaels. The graphs (at least in the digital version of the book) also are pretty hard to read as compared to the ones that Michael use. 

I know that Kobayashi-Solomon is working on a Udemy course but it's been over a year and it has not been completed. 

Has anyone come across any video resources or any other written material that does a good job explaining how one could find mispriced options and use them as a tool for long-term investing and not simply for trading and speculations. 

Has anyone else used options for value investing? I know that other value investors such as Joel Greenblatt have used them to help them buy mispriced stocks such as Well's Fargo back in the 08 stock market crash.

I didn’t sell a single share. As of writing this, $GTHX sits at $26.89, which is a BARGAIN for what’s about to come next for this company, short and long-term. Why am I so confident? Read an actual DD below unlike my shitty one from last week.
  
**What is COSELA?**  
Last week, [COSELA became the only FDA-approved therapy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-g1-therapeutics-cosela-004100120.html) to help proactively deliver multi-lineage myeloprotection to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer being treated with chemotherapy. Not only is the drug going to be used for lung cancer as early as next month, but G1 is currently conducting trials for COSELA’s benefits in other cancers as well, such as breast cancer. If their results are as positive as they were for lung cancer, the goldmine grows tenfold.  
  
**Commercialization**  
With pharmaceutical companies, one of the biggest concerns following their trial stages as they transition into the commercialization stage is whether they have the funds or resources to make it happen. With G1, this should not be an issue, as they have [partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim](http://investor.g1therapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/g1-therapeutics-and-boehringer-ingelheim-announce-co-promotion/), one of the worlds leading pharmaceutical companies and a giant in the lung-cancer department. G1 has expressed that this move is not only going to allow them to commercialize the drug in a cost-efficient manner, but also continue their research on COSELA’s effects on other cancers. With COSELA’s distribution beginning next month, this will dramatically increase revenue.
  
**Analyst Price Targets**  
After the approval of COSELA, the average price target has increased to $60.17, with $83 being the high end and $41 the low end.   
  
**Institutional Holdings**
Institutions own 77.43% of the current shares, and institutions aren’t known to abruptly sell off, AKA they are in it for the long run. With such a large percent being held by institutions (someone correct me if I’m wrong, I believe this is correct), this can allow a huge increase in share price with even a *small* amount of retail interest, which I believe is bound to come sooner or later. At the end of the day yesterday, an above-average increase in volume shot the price up almost a full dollar.  
  
**Earnings on Wednesday**  
As always, there is potential for a price bump at earnings, and their Q4 earnings report is this Wednesday after hours, as well as a 2020 recap.  
  
**Conclusion**  
$GTHX has flown under the radar for a while now and I believe it’s only up from here. I’m bullish as fuck and believe the upsides vastly outweigh any downsides. I have purchased more shares during the dip and hope to see some great returns in the near future.

If I stay in FL, should i keep the home in CA under my name collecting the rent  (500$ after all costs) or transfer into some type of business. Also if I wanted to sell the home in CA and invest in properties in FL. Is that when it makes sense to start a business, transfer the CA home or the profits from it, or buy then transfer.

the CA home at the moment could sell for a substantial amount of cash above what I owe, while I collect about 500$ a month in profit from it. selling it and buying 3-6 homes in FL (if i wanted to pay in full vs half down and half borrowed), can provide somewhere around 4000-5000$ a month instead. while I'm jumping ahead and assuming I'm going to want to stay here, selling in CA is a big decide but if I was to go ahead and do it, what would be the best way to do this correctly for the future."|investing|transferring home into business or transfer sales profit|0.0|0.38

The latest Democratic proposal for $1,400 payments for singles earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would cost about $422 BILLION—with most of that money being disbursed in a matter of months. In a study focused on the first stimulus payment done last year, those with incomes between $35k and $150k decided to significantly increase their exposure to investing. If someone has some good estimates or ideas on how much of the coming stimulus payments will flow into the financial markets, it would be much appreciated.

Whatever the estimate is of how much will flow into the investment market, my main point is that I think speculative assets have room to run with the stimulus checks coming out.

I am planning on placing some trades once the cash disbursement process ramps up next month. If anyone has sectors or types of securities, which will be most receptive to this phenomenon, that would be great. If you have ideas about specific trades, even better. The areas I'm looking at mostly involve more long-term positioning in industry more resilient to inflation like oil (I'm liking Exxon Mobile and Chevron). However, I'm happy to discuss and engage with others and their opinions.

Hi, I recently started to look at the different economic variables, what makes them fluctuate, their effects, etc. However, there's still many more knowledge I need to get to understand better the economy, etc. As I was reading article on the Fed fund rates, the 10 year treasury yield and more. I stumbled on this article: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-signals-the-top-of-a-bull-market-in-stocks-not-rising-interest-rates-11613490352](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-signals-the-top-of-a-bull-market-in-stocks-not-rising-interest-rates-11613490352)

Basically, it says that in the last 7 out of the 9 bull markets came to an end when the Fed lowered the fed fund rate. Therefore, I don't understand why the market would be down if the fed fund rate goes down. My logic was that if it goes down, then people would borrow more money, because the cost would be less.

Also, in the article, it says: "" the most recent move in the Federal Funds rate was last March, when the Fed cut it by a full percentage point. "" After that, there was a decline in the market. Could it be that it's not because of the market but because of many other variables?

From the CNBC Article...

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/rise-in-treasury-yields-prompts-speculation-of-a-tantrum-for-markets.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/rise-in-treasury-yields-prompts-speculation-of-a-tantrum-for-markets.html)

Key Points :

* **The “taper tantrum” in 2013 was a sudden spike in Treasury yields due to market panic after the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program.**
* **Major central banks around the world have cut interest rates to historic lows and launched unprecedented quantities of asset purchases in a bid to shore up the economy throughout the pandemic.**
* **However, the recent rise in yields suggests that some investors are starting to anticipate a tightening of policy sooner than anticipated to accommodate a potential rise in inflation.**

The recent rise in bond yields and U.S. inflation expectations has some investors wary that a repeat of the 2013 “taper tantrum” could be on the horizon.

The benchmark [U.S. 10-year Treasury note](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y) climbed above 1.3% for the first time since February 2020 earlier this week, while the [30-year bond](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US30Y) also hit its highest level for a year. Yields move inversely to bond prices.

Yields tend to rise in lockstep with inflation expectations, which have reached their highest levels in a decade in the U.S., powered by increased prospects of a large fiscal stimulus package, progress on vaccine rollouts and pent-up consumer demand.

The “taper tantrum” in 2013 was a sudden spike in Treasury yields due to market panic after the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program.

Major central banks around the world have [cut interest rates to historic lows and launched unprecedented quantities of asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/fed-decision-january-2021-rates-unchanged.html) in a bid to shore up the economy throughout the pandemic. The Fed and others have maintained supportive tones in recent policy meetings, vowing to keep financial conditions loose as the global economy looks to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.

However, the recent rise in yields suggests that some investors are starting to anticipate a tightening of policy sooner than anticipated to accommodate a potential rise in inflation.

With central bank support removed, bonds usually fall in price which sends yields higher. This can also spill over into stock markets as higher interest rates means more debt servicing for firms, causing traders to reassess the investing environment.

“The supportive stance from policymakers will likely remain in place until the vaccines have paved a way to some return to normality,” said Shane Balkham, chief investment officer at Beaufort Investment, in a research note this week.

“However, there will be a risk of another ‘taper tantrum’ similar to the one we witnessed in 2013, and this is our main focus for 2021,” Balkham projected, should policymakers begin to unwind this stimulus.

Long-term bond yields in Japan and Europe followed U.S. Treasurys higher toward the end of the week as bondholders shifted their portfolios.

“The fear is that these assets are priced to perfection when the ECB and Fed might eventually taper,” said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management, in a research note entitled “Little taper tantrum.”

“The odds of tapering are helped in the United States by better retail sales after four months of disappointment and the expectation of large issuance from the $1.9 trillion fiscal package.”

Galy suggested the Fed would likely extend the duration on its asset purchases, moderating the upward momentum in inflation.

“Equity markets have reacted negatively to higher yield as it offers an alternative to the dividend yield and a higher discount to long-term cash flows, making them focus more on medium-term growth such as cyclicals” he said. Cyclicals are stocks whose performance tends to align with economic cycles.

Galy expects this process to be more marked in the second half of the year when economic growth picks up, increasing the potential for tapering.

## Tapering in the U.S., but not Europe

[Allianz](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALV-DE) CEO Oliver Bäte told CNBC on Friday that there was a geographical divergence in how the German insurer is thinking about the prospect of interest rate hikes.

“One is Europe, where we continue to have financial repression, where the ECB continues to buy up to the max in order to minimize spreads between the north and the south — the strong balance sheets and the weak ones — and at some point somebody will have to pay the price for that, but in the short term I don’t see any spike in interest rates,” Bäte said, adding that the situation is different stateside.

“Because of the massive programs that have happened, the stimulus that is happening, the dollar being the world’s reserve currency, there is clearly a trend to stoke inflation and it is going to come. Again, I don’t know when and how, but the interest rates have been steepening and they should be steepening further.”

## Rising yields a ‘normal feature’

However, not all analysts are convinced that the rise in bond yields is material for markets. In a note Friday, Barclays Head of European Equity Strategy Emmanuel Cau suggested that rising bond yields were overdue, as they had been lagging the improving macroeconomic outlook for the second half of 2021, and said they were a “normal feature” of economic recovery.

“With the key drivers of inflation pointing up, the prospect of even more fiscal stimulus in the U.S. and pent up demand propelled by high excess savings, it seems right for bond yields to catch-up with other more advanced reflation trades,” Cau said, adding that central banks remain “firmly on hold” given the balance of risks.

He argued that the steepening yield curve is “typical at the early stages of the cycle,” and that so long as vaccine rollouts are successful, growth continues to tick upward and central banks remain cautious, reflationary moves across asset classes look “justified” and equities should be able to withstand higher rates.

“Of course, after the strong move of the last few weeks, equities could mark a pause as many sectors that have rallied with yields look overbought, like commodities and banks,” Cau said.

“But at this stage, we think rising yields are more a confirmation of the equity bull market than a threat, so dips should continue to be bought.”"|investing|Rise in Treasury yields prompts speculation of a ‘tantrum’ for markets|533.0|0.96

I perhaps have some bias here as I'm a Brit based on the the U.S. (I feel I should disclose this), but I want to outline why I think it's a good time to invest if you're looking for more international exposure.

I'm not going to sell this as an investment that'll get you 10x your return anytime soon, but I do think there are arguments it should be a ""buy"" as there are signs its going to have a good year. Over the next year I'm hoping for a return of above 10% inc. dividends and hopefully closer to 15% assuming no market crash.

# Composition

Details of the FTSE 100 composition can be found [here](https://fknol.com/uk/market-cap-ftse-100-index-constituents.php). A sector-by-sector analysis can be found [here](https://siblisresearch.com/data/ftse-100-sector-weights/).

Over the past decade the FTSE has been dragged down due, in part, to high exposure to mining and materials stock. However, there are signs these companies  are [making a come-back after a decade of low growth](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-commodities-kemp/column-non-energy-commodity-prices-rise-at-fastest-rate-since-2011-kemp-idUSKBN29X28O). Energy companies are an exception to this due to the drop in oil prices. However, the two big players in the UK energy space are BP and Shell. Both  have committed to phase out oil production by 2050 and are shifting towards being providers of alternative, clean energy. They are using their oil revenue to pivot moreso in this space.

The FTSE is also weighted towards financial services and pharma stocks. Pharma is obviously a hot sector right now, but [2021 is predicted, by some, to be a great year for the banking industry](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bank-stocks-are-going-to-be-higher-next-year-expert-says-51608550200).

The FTSE _is_ lacking in tech stocks (also hot right now), but this may be viewed as a good thing if you believe tech is overvalued right now.

# The elephant in the room: Brexit

When British companies are brought up, Brexit is often raised as a reason not to invest. However, I think it's very important to consider that [75% of the revenue from the FTSE 100 comes from outside of the UK](https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/218334/why-the-ftse-100-is-not-the-uks-economic-bellwether-218334.html). The index is heavily weighted to those with a very international presence.

Even thought the FTSE 100 does appear to have lackluster performance over the 4.5 years since brexit (based on price), the FTSE 100 companies have been largely unaffected by the crisis, and have continued to remain profitable.

There was a big spike in the FTSE once the Brexit deal was announced. As the UK adjusts to the ""new normal"", and the Brexit stink dissipates, i suspect confidence will return and investment will follow.

# Price

On face value, the index is still quite a bit below the highs seen over the last decade: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/stock-market. At the time of writing it's trading 15% lower than its 2018 peak.

# Price to earnings

The [FTSE 100 P/E was 17.5 at the end of 2020]. This is somewhat inline with the historical average. I would argue this is pretty decent for the 2020 year. If we assume earnings given a normal year would've be higher, then the price is quite a bit below the long term average and suggests good value.

# Dividends

The FTSE 100 yield has been between [3.8 to 4.7% for the 2015 to 2020 period](https://siblisresearch.com/data/ftse-all-total-return-dividend/). The S&amp;P 500 by comparison has been between [1.6 to 2% since 2016](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_dividend_yield). The FTSE's 3.7% over 2020 seems particularly impressive given the COVID crisis when so many big names in the FTSE (Shell, for example) famously cut dividends. I would argue dividend payout should increase over the next couple of years and as such the share price should adjust accordingly. A 3.5% dividend is also pretty decent even if the value of the stock does not improve significantly.

# Current political situation / COVID

The Conservative party are almost certainly in power until 2025, and given their pro-business nature, I would doubt they are going to interfere too much into corporate affairs. The Conservative party has also officially decided it's going to give state aid to UK companies (which was previously against EU rules). So, in short, you could buy into stock being propped by UK tax payers.

The UK is also likely to be a western country that will open up its economy in the 2nd half of 2021 due to its very impressive vaccination efforts (at the time of writing [roughly 1/3rd of the UK population has received one jab, with that heavily leaning towards ""at risk"" groups](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55274833)). Of the British companies affected by COVID, this should bring about a boost and allow businesses to return to some normality faster than other nations.

# How to invest

If you're willing to buy on UK markets, there's no shortage of ETFs that track the FTSE 100. The closest I've found in the US there is **FLGB**, which isn't an exact match but does track the FTSE 100 constituent companies to a reasonable extent.

at the day of writing this post, their shares costs as follows:

UUUU: $ **5.770**  \--&gt; 1y change =  +4.330 (+300.69%) 

UEC: $ **2.500  --&gt;** 1y change = +1.633 (+188.38%) 

CCJ: $ **16.600  --&gt;** 1y change = +7.4444 (+81.31%) 

So now question is to you: do you think that going into this maket at current levels is reasonable? How to assess if those companies aren't pupmed up and will suddenly fall by 50% or so?"|investing|Taking a look at uranium mining companies in 2021|34.0|0.85

I have the capital needed to buy whole shares, but I only want about 5% of my total portfolio to be allocated to these individual equities. They are mostly meant to round out my broader exposure. My portfolio doesn't have exposure to a few of the stocks I want and these are companies that really should be included in the portfolio.

That being said, my idea is to open a Roth IRA at Fidelity, buy fractional shares of the companies I want, and then transfer those partial shares to TD Ameritrade. That's where my Roth IRA is currently custodied. I want everything in one account as much as possible to be able to track allocation, performance, etc. I don't want to have to go looking at multiple accounts at multiple brokers. My only question is... Would TD Ameritrade hold these partial shares once I transferred them? Or would they liquidate, thus making the whole thing pointless? I'm also exploring M1 Finance, and while I'm sure they're great in not sure that they will give me what I need.

Any insight would be much appreciated. Thanks."|investing|Fractional Share Transfer|3.0|0.62

Decided to look into Clover Health (Ticker: CLOV) since I’ve been hearing recommendation on it for the dip. Started with all the pros of the company and thought it was great! Growth! Growth! Growth! But then once I got to the cons that hype dropped to the ground fast. I wanted to create this post to save time for anyone that might be interested in CLOV. Citations are at the end so you can do your own research. I do have a position in CLOV as I think the stock could rebound a little via technical analysis. Not a financial advice.

**Summary (if lazy):**

A stock that was hyped by Chamath. If cleared by DOJ and short, there are potential for growth. However, some allegations are hard to turn your head the other way. Also, important to note that it’s David vs bunch of Goliath in this heavily regulated industry. CEO kinda sketchy. At this point, cons over weighs the pros.

Atm price dropped down to a pretty good resistance near $10.60 - $11.00, I’ll be buying hoping for rebound with news fading away and earnings on March 1.

My position atm is **~~15 $12.5 CALL 5/21~~**

**Update 2/22:** After further research, seeing how every other MA company has had bad reaction after earnings, I've decided to let go my position today.

*\*\*Post will be edited and updated based off any informative comments.*

**Basic Info of the Company:**

**1** **About the company**

* Clover health is a data driven healthcare technology company (Backed by Alphabet Inc/Google) based in San Francisco that provides Medicare Advantage products to seniors and low-income members. As of early 2020 they had 57,000 members with plans offered in 34 counties across seven state. Their plan for expansion will bring coverage to a total of 64 additional counties. This expansion will increase Clover’s market opportunity to nearly 5 million Medicare eligible.

**2** **Difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plan**

* Original Medicare (parts A and B) is offered by the government and covers some of the costs of hospitals (part A) and doctor visits (part B) – but it may not offer the full coverage you need. This can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to significant costs if you need to visit the hospital.
* Medicare Advantage plans (part C) give you all the coverage of original Medicare and often include part D prescription drug coverage. In addition, they may offer dental and vision benefit + others…

**3** **What’s different about Clover Advantage Plan**

* As stated at #1, Clover Health provides Medicare Advantage Plan. Which means they will cover everything stated above in #2. Additionally, they give you access to better prescription drug coverage than standalone part D plans, as well as additional benefits like low cost.

**4 They have a unique model in health insurance**

* Clover partners with primary care physicians using its software platform, the Clover Assistant, to deliver data-driven, personalized insights at the point of care.

# Pros

**1. Clover Assistant**

* This is their flagship platform that aggregates millions of relevant health data points – including claims, medical charts, and diagnostics, among others – and uses machine learning to synthesize that data with member-specific information. This provides physicians with actionable and personalized insights at the point of care, offering suggestions for medications and dosages as well as the need for tests or referrals, among other, to ultimately improve health outcomes^(1\*).
* Basically, this new software makes the doctors happy (unlike the legacy systems) and makes the patients happy as it allows them to save money and have better patient outcomes.

**2.** **Fastest Growing Medicare advantage insurer in the US**

* Clover captured an average of 50% of the net increase in membership across its established markets over the last three years. Because of their target demographic, it makes it easier for them to expand into historically undeserved and rural communities. As mentioned above, they are planning to expand into an additional 74 counties and announced a new partnership with Walmart to make joint Clover-Walmart plans available to half a million medicare-eligibles in the eight Georgia counties.

**3. The market**

* The health market is one of the largest in the country representing $3.8 trillion or 17.8% of gross domestic product in 2019. Furthermore, healthcare expenditures are forecasted to grow to $6.2 trillion by 2028. An important part of this market is the insurance industry, and more specifically the Medicare plans which in 2020 had more than 62 million people enrolled in, and 39% of those people (24.1million) enrolled in Medicare advantage plans.^(2\*)

&amp;#x200B;

# Cons

**1.** **Hindenburg Research**

This is one of the major catalysts to investors when it comes to investing in CLOV. I’ll go over some of the main issue from the Hindenburg research and answers provided by Clover Health. If you’d like to check out the report yourself checkout citation below^(3\*).

It’s important to note that Clover Health did provide a rebuttal/answers (quite long) to all the points on Hindenburg Research^(4\*). Hindenburg then replied to that as well lol^(5\*).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Critically Clover has not disclosed that its business model and its software offering, called the clover assistant, are under active investigation by the DOJ, which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kick backs to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a civil investigative demand we obtained.*

* Clover Response - Discussed to lawyer about it, and they said it’s not necessary to let the public know.
* Thoughts – Really comes down to SPEC vs IPO, with SPEC being looser and in the grey area. It would have been the right thing to inform the public investors of these information, now they’ll have to deal with all the lawsuits. Next, the civil investigative demand from DOJ was received by a formal employee of CLOV and not CLOV itself. CLOV did receive a request for information from DOJ but not a civil investigative demands or subpoenas from DOJ. This tells me it’s unclear if an investigation have been opened for CLOV or if it’s just inquiries jumping around.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover has a thinly disclosed subsidiary called “Seek Insurance”. Seek makes no mention of its relationship with Clover on its website yet misleadingly advertises to seniors that it offers “independent” and “unbiased” advice on selecting Medicare plans. It claims, “We don’t work for insurance companies. We work for you”, despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. Its activities are also under investigation by the DOJ.

* Clover Response – Seek is a start up that is set up as a separate company from clover. Provides seek sales in the most recent AEP: #1 Cigna:20%, #2 Humana:20%, #3 CVS/Aetna:17%, #4 Clover:13.5%...
* Thoughts – Doesn’t look good on Clover’s end. Seek can’t state it provides unbiased report when 50% of its stake is owned by clover.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Multiple former employees explained that much of Clover’s sales are fueled by a major undisclosed relationship between Clover and an outside brokerage firm controlled by Clover’s Head of Sales, Hiram Bermudez. One former employee estimated Bermudez drove \~68% of Clover’s total sales, though was unclear on the amount coming from the undisclosed relationship.

* Clover Response – Admits that there is transaction between B&amp;H assurance and says Bermudez still work on behalf of B&amp;H in case he quits Clover.
* Thoughts – Admitting to this is good but 100% conflict of interest. However, its not unusual for insurance companies to use brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover reported that “onboarded” physicians used Clover Assistant for 92% of member visits in 2019, but never defined “onboarded”. We found that less than half of Clover’s in-network doctors are considered “Clover Preferred”. What is the definition of an “onboarded” physician? What percentage of Clover’s in-network doctors actually use the Clover Assistant?

* Clover Response –onboarding = physicians that went through training for clover assistant.contracting = explained benefit of clover assistant to the physicians and they have agreed to use it.Currently 22% of all in-network primary care physicians are live. This correlate to 4% of the total in-network physicians. In YE2020 56% of the membership were attributed to one of those 22% live PCPs. And an additional 11% are attributed to a PCP who is contracted but in the onboarding pipeline. In conclusion, 67% total coverage of clover assistant as of YE2020
* Thoughts – wordings are confusing on clovers part, but the numbers do not look as bad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Clover claims its software “delights” physicians, but according to doctors and former employees we interviewed, they use it because Clover pays them extra to use it. Physicians are paid $200 per visit to use the software, twice the normal reimbursement rate for a Medicare visit.

* Clover Response – just incentivizing to use the software. The $200 is not to use the software but represents the overall payment that covers both the PCP office visit and the use of the clover assistant.
* Thoughts – Clover were pretty up front about this issue, not too relevant imo.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In a CNBC interview announcing the Clover transaction, Chamath proclaimed, unprompted, “they create transparency…they don’t motivate doctors to up code or do all kinds of things to get paid”. A former employee explained to us that the DOJ is specifically asking about upcoding, or the practice of overbilling Medicare.

* Clover Response – agrees upcoding is a problem in the industry. They pay pcp fixed flat payment per office visit which does not incentivize physicians to up code. They keep old diagnosis just in case, so it shows up again
* Thoughts – I don’t think it was well addressed how their system fails to remove old irrelevant diagnoses which could affect Medicare advantage reimbursements leading to upcoding.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.** **CEO of Clover Health is kinda sketchy**

Before I start, it’s important to note that these information below were available in 2020 before the merger announcement. I’ll just directly copy paste what Hindenburg report wrote but you can find different articles on google^(3\*).

* Prior to founding Clover, CEO Vivek Garipalli owned 3 New Jersey hospitals through a company called CarePoint Health. CarePoint was publicly lambasted for price-gouging; its hospital charged the highest prices for emergency room treatment in the entire country. For example, local media reported that Garipalli’s hospitals charged a teacher $9,000 for a bandaged finger and a tetanus shot, and another patient $17,000 for 5-6 stiches on a cut hand.
* CarePoint’s predatory price-gouging was lucrative. But in 2020, New Jersey legislators accused Garipalli – now a public company CEO – of siphoning over $157 million from his hospital network through a byzantine web of LLC shell entities. The transactions left the hospitals financially crippled, leading to layoffs and a liquidating sale process to new owners.

**3.** **Hyped by Chamath Palihapaitityasfga**

* People love Chamath

Again, Not a financial Advice.

TDS is currently trading for less than book value.  I feel now is a great opportunity to buy. 

What I like:

* EPS increasing and increases exceed expectations 

* Their recent expansion into fiber optic internet appears to be successful.  I found out about TDS when I got their internet this past December and am a happy customer.   Most of my neighborhood switched over to TDS from Charter and are happy with the switch.  

* Strong balance sheet - $1.4B cash.  Excellent cash flow from operations - $1.5B in 2020.  

* They continue to increase dividend. 

* They are small and have opportunity to pick up a lot of market share over the next few years. 

* Improving network to be able to provide 5G - make US Cellular more competitive 

* Own their own towers 

What I don’t like:

* TDS is parent of US Cellular and US cellular is not the cheapest of any price point for phone plans (1, 2, 3, 4 people).  I haven’t heard great things about it either. I personally have never considered US Cellular for phone service.  

* TDS fiber growth (what I am most excited about) is in mainly rural areas - less people to buy since it is sparsely populated. 

* TDS and US Cellular operate in a very competitive market where customers are willing to switch quickly 

* They are a boring company.  They aren’t going to get publicity to generate interest in their stock.

\-Corsair has a high total debt to equity ratio versus the overall tech sector. Corsair's 0.73 v. The tech sector's 0.04\[10\]\[11\]

\-Cost of revenue increased from 872,887 to 1,236,938 (TTM) between 2019 to 2020\[13\]

\-Corsair Gaming's lock-up period expires on Monday, March 22nd which will drop the stock an average of 1% - 3%\[15\]

# Bullish case:

\-Corsair has diversied into the streaming market, they own Elgato and have bought impulse\[4\]

\-Corsair has a low price to earnings ratio versus the overall tech sector. Corsair's 27.77 v. The tech sector's 45.49 \[7\]\[8\]

\-Corsairs debt to equity ratio has decreased from 2.051 in July 2020 to 0.735 in Feburary 2021\[10\]

\-The interest coverage of Corsair is 3.00\[12\]

\-Total revenue increased from 1,097,174 to 1,702,367 (TTM) between 2019 to 2020\[13\]

\-The site ""simply wallstreet"" predicts a fair value of Corsair gaming at $65.00\[14\]

(Not directly bullish) -The gaming market and streaming market are up from 2020. \[5\]\[6\]

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corsair has bad fundementals, however I believe this move into streaming is a good one. Targetting people who want to become streamers and selling corsair products is a great way to increase profits within the companies attmosphere. Corsair's CEO expressed interest in streaming boot camps and training. If heading into this direction, Corsair can eat up Chinese market share when looking to create stablized boot camps to create streamers. If Corsair does go in this direction they can create a new revenue source by contracting the streamers they trained, taking a percentage of their profits and advertising Corsair products to the audience.

I see a lot of people compare Corsair to Logitech $LOGI which is fair until you realize that Corsair is more than just a gaming accessories company. They create computers and buy software related to streaming. Logitech is a company that makes products for gamers and trational companies and consumers while Corsair focuses on gamers and now streamers. This difference seems small until you realize that Corsair doesn't have a real direct competitor.

The blue ocean strategy approach Corsair has taken to be able to cement themselves into the gaming community will pay off 10 fold in the future. I believe that Corsair will be synonyms with gaming and gaming culture making it worth more because of the brand rather than the fundemental book value.

I believe that paying anywhere $38.50 - $42.60 per share is a good investment for **short-term** investors. As a **long-term** investor buying in at any price will pay off in 5 to 10 years.

Corsair Gaming has a lot to offer and I am excited to see where it goes in the future.

Strictly land, with no plans to do anything with it but maintain it. I understand the rules about not staying on it as it will be owned via an IRA, paying expenses and receiving any benefits right to the IRA, no sweat equity, etc.

Here is my my situation. I live in a development of all 3 acre homes. Directly behind my house is a 75 acre piece of property in ""preserved farmland"" protection; meaning it can support one potential home and can only be used to farm or to generate solar on a small piece. I have a hunch it will be up for sale in the next few years. My wife and I are 37 with very retirement heavy portfolios. Combined, we are just under $1m. I suspect the land could be had for $500k; effectively using half of our retirement savings.

Is this a sound investment idea, or is this too risky or radical?

Here are what I consider the benefits:

1. Hedge against stock valuations and dollar/inflation
2. Diversification in assets
3. While we can't use it to the extent we'd like, we'd benefit from being able to ride an ATV around it to check on it, or to have the kids sledding on it
4. Potential leasing of land to farmers (who can maintain it) as well as solar, as there is electric access up and down the road
5. We'd live next to it, it would feel like an ext. of our property, it could theoretically be broken up into smaller parcels
6. Both of us can continue to fund our 401's generously, and we have other savings set aside as well

Here are our concerns:

1. Spending 45% of our retirement money on a hard asset just feels strange given everything taught
2. The complexities of setting up the self directed IRA/Checkbook LLC
3. Going foul of the IRS laws will be difficult given our properties are connected"|investing|Self-directed IRA to buy land|33.0|0.83

The change in business tactics, however, is likely to help Lumen Technologies improve its cash flow profile, even after taking a small hit on earnings. This will likely lead to stellar returns in the coming years as most of the savings will be passed on to shareholders via dividends and buybacks.

1613772160.0|0.0|t3_lnrl28|381.0|"AppHarvest is a publicly traded Indoor Farming based in the US. While there are several other in door farming companies like Gotham Greens and AeroFarms, APPH is the only one of the bunch that is publicly traded. Indoor farming, IMO is the future, and there currently is no dominant company like Tesla, Amazon, Apple in the AggTech Space. APPH only has a market cap of $4B. **Investing in APPH will not only position you for the future, but also allow you to capitalize on the sustainability movement**.

The market share of indoor farms in the total aggriculture market is very small, giving lots of room for growth. Indoor farming only produces  roughly 14B of goods compared to 400b of production in US.  **At a market cap of 4B, I bought APPH for the growth potential and my belief that there will one day be a dominant Aggtech player and that indoor farms will take over farming in the future**.  In comparison, Tesla has a 750B market cap.

APPH is based in Kentucky. The founder, Jonathan Webb grew up in Kentucky and went to University of Kentucky. It makes me feel like he's in this for the long haul and wants to give back to the community there. Webb has aspirations to make Kentucky the Aggtech capital of USA. Kentucky is also a strategic location in that it has cheap land and access to rain water. [https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article246585233.html](https://www.kentucky.com/news/state/kentucky/article246585233.html)

So why indoor farming:

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Benefits Of Indoor Farming**: This is pretty self explanatory but I will name a few

* **Less use of water**: APPH and other indoor farms claim to use 90% less water than conventional farms. [https://www.appharvest.com/](https://www.appharvest.com/)
* **Can grow year round**
* **Not dependent on climate**
* **Can be done vertically to take up less space**
* **Can be grown without the use of pesticides** \- decreasing chemicals released

In a nutshell, Indoor Farming is the way of the future. With climate change, outdoor farming has become unpredictable. Much of US farming is only able to sell their goods for so cheap due to subsidies. Fresh water is also decreasing and desalination is expensive. [https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water) The human population continues to grow and food shortages is a legitimate problem - hence some companies are looking into bugs as the protein of the future. [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/climate/climate-change-food-supply.html) , [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/bug-protein-how-entrepreneurs-are-persuading-americans-to-eat-insects.html) No matter what the solution is, the fact is, **we need to feed humans and we need to do it in a more efficient way**.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Indoor Farming vs. Conventional Farming**:

Currently, indoor farming is still a bit more expensive than conventional farming. APPH is selling it's tomatoes as 'organic' which allows it to price it higher. However, the trend is reversing. While outdoor farming continues to face increasing costs due to use of pesticides, climate change, and water costs, indoor farming faces the opposite problem. Many US outdoor farms are only able to sell at cheap prices due to subsidies. Advancements in technology well continue to decrease the costs for indoor farming. Conventional farms also usually are located far from populous areas and will have additional supply chain costs. Indoor farms can be located wherever it makes sense to be located. For more info: [https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture](https://www.growcomputer.io/blog/2020/3/9/change-in-agriculture)

Costs of indoor farming include the initial investment cost of building the facility. After that, the main repeat cost is electricity to power the led lamps. However, it is still sustainable after electric costs: [https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/post/is-vertical-farming-really-sustainable) Indoor farms as mentioned see vast reduction in needs for water, pesticides, land area, supply chain, and other costs that traditional farms see.

**Indoor farming is already very successful**. Believe it or not, tiny Neterhlands is the SECOND largest exporter of food by $ value, after the US - all due to the their ability to farm indoors. National Geographic did an excerpt here: [https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article\_final-A4.pdf](https://investinholland.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NFIA-National-Geographic-Article_final-A4.pdf) , [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4863106/The-hi-tech-future-farming-Netherlands.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4863106/The-hi-tech-future-farming-Netherlands.html)In door farm technology can be used to grow crops anywhere, even in the Sahara.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Indoor Farming Has ALOT of Potential**: Besides what's listed above, indoor farming can leverage AI in making farms automated and increase yield. Tech companies have been investing in indoor farms due to the potential to use technology and AI to increase yield and produce crops. [http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming](http://economyleague.org/providing-insight/regional-direction/2018/08/10/the-promise-and-peril-of-vertical-farming) Additionally, the US governemnt has been eyeing ways to support indoor farming: [https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2018/08/14/vertical-farming-future)

I truely believe, whether or not people like to think in those terms, that water and food will become a scarcer resource in the future. I also truly believe that indoor farming is the future, especially as we as humans look to become more sustainable.

I'm not usually big on celebrity endorsers, but Martha Stewart is firmly behind APPH. [https://www.greenhousegrower.com/crops/martha-stewart-among-big-names-joining-appharvest-team/](https://www.greenhousegrower.com/crops/martha-stewart-among-big-names-joining-appharvest-team/)

Like any budding industry, the market is currently pretty fragmented, but APPH is the one I am backing due to strategic location, tech, and company CEO. They also have David Lee on the team, who was the CFO of Impossible Foods.  This means it's ripe for a dominant player to show up. All indoor farms should grow and capture some market share from traditional farms, regardless who you back.

Market cap: 4.71B

Share price at time of writing: $28.40

IPO date 5/21/2020, closing IPO day price: $27

I believe $SLQT is a still 'hidden gem' growth stock. They have been executing flawlessly quarter after quarter since their IPO last year, by leveraging their proprietary machine learning technology to improve agent productivity and accelerate sales.

Founded in 1985, SelectQuote helps consumers purchase complex senior health, life, auto, and home insurance policies from a curated panel of the nation's leading insurance carriers. They were the first direct-to-consumer term life insurance exchange platform in the U.S. The company doesn't provide the insurance, but rather finds consumers looking to buy it and matches them with insurance carriers. SelectQuote earns commissions from the insurance carriers for the policies it sells on their behalf.

It has a total addressable market (TAM) of at least $180 billion for the insurance products its distributes. The company believes the TAM presents an annual commission revenue opportunity of roughly $28 billion for its seniors segment, $105 billion in life insurance, and $47 billion in auto and home insurance. In each of those three segments, **SelectQuote estimates its market share to be less than 1% and thinks there is a lot of potential for better market penetration and market growth.**

**SLQT had** total revenue of $337.5 million in fiscal 2019, up 44% from sales in fiscal 2018.

In 2020, they had 534 million revenue, up 58%

Now, they expect **76% revenue increase for 2021** over full year 2020.

**This is accelerating revenue growth.**

They have had blowout quarters, including most recent earnings Feb 8,  2021:

\-Consolidated revenue up 103% YoY, 68% gross margins

\-**2021 guidance raised twice in a row already** (in Nov and again this Feb). Full year 2021 revenue of 940M now expected, 76% increase over full year 2020.

\-Profitable, **adj EBITDA up 88% YoY** with better margins than its competitors EHealth (EHTH) and GoHealth (GOCO) which are growing much slower and losing money. Note that SLQT's other 'competitor' is Everquote (EVER) which is more concentrated in auto sales (80% revenue) and still losing money, while SelectQuote has auto comprising &lt;20% of its revenue

\-proprietary machine learning platform to drive sales efficiency. Agent productivity steadily increasing (see [https://s23.q4cdn.com/545595037/files/doc\_financials/2021/q2/SelectQuote-Inc.-December-31-2020-10-Q-Earnings-Presentation-VFINAL.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/545595037/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SelectQuote-Inc.-December-31-2020-10-Q-Earnings-Presentation-VFINAL.pdf) )

\-The Biden admin desire to expand Medicare age to 60, would be a MASSIVE tailwind to sector if it ever goes through

**VALUATION:**

Enterprise value 4.86B

Forward EV/S: 4.3x

Considering that other tech growth companies are growing slower and aren't even profitable plus with worse gross margins (like for example, FUBO is trading at 12.3x forward EV/S), I believe SLQT should trade at minimum at 8x forward EV/S. The stock price should at least be double what it is today, if not more. My target price is $60 before end of 2021.

**ANALYST COVERAGE:**

&gt;2/9/2021: Evercore ISI analyst Elizabeth Anderson raised the firm's price target on SelectQuote to $38 from $35 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares, noting that the company ""had a very strong AEP"" but despite robust growth its LTVs remained stable. The Q2 results ""come as a relief and further reinforce its differentiated business model,"" according to Anderson, who adds that she is excited by SelectQuote's continued initiatives to deepen relationships with carriers.  
&gt;	
&gt;2/9/2021:  Barclays analyst Steve Valiquette raised the firm’s price target on SelectQuote to $36 from $32 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Industry concerns were put to rest with a “strong quarter” from SelectQuote, Valiquette tells investors in a research note.

**RISKS:**

\-Implementation of single payer health will be very bad, but this seems highly unlikely on the horizon

\-Insider trading has shown selling, but I believe this is because they have not been able to sell at a decent price since IPO date; the price of stock traded below IPO for much of last year until finally the market started to recognize their success recently. It was probably very frustrating that they couldn’t cash out some of gains until now.

\-Competition in the massive TAM is heating up. Walmart made an entry last year (July 2020: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/08/walmart-quietly-registers-insurance-business-in-its-latest-move-into-health-care.html ) 

However, per Citi’s analyst (10/6/2020):

&gt;	After Walmart (WMT) announced it is launching Walmart Insurance Services, a licensed insurance brokerage, Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said he views the company’s entry into the Medicare Advantage broker market as “a significant competitive threat to the tech-enabled DTC brokers,” particularly eHealth (EHTH). He views the platform as most comparable to eHealth’s, citing the ability to search for plans and enroll completely online without speaking with an agent, and believes SelectQuote (SLQT) should “be relatively better protected” given its high touch approach and diversification, Grosslight tells investors.

""Volkswagen AG is considering a separate listing of its Porsche sports-car unit in a deal that could boost its valuation and bring in a significant amount of cash, according to people familiar with the matter.

The world’s second-largest carmaker is speaking with advisers to study the merits of a potential initial public offering or spinoff of Porsche, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. VW could use any proceeds from a listing for acquisitions or technology investments, according to the people.

Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess sounded the alarm in an interview with Bloomberg News last month about how Tesla Inc. and other electric-vehicle companies are cashing in on market optimism about their growth prospects. Investors have taken a dimmer view of VW and other incumbents, who will need to spend tens of billions to develop EVs while restructuring operations that revolve around combustion engines.

VW’s preferred shares rose as much as 6% in Frankfurt trading. At about $757 billion, Tesla’s market value is roughly seven times higher than VW’s 90 billion euros ($109 billion).

“A Volkswagen IPO of its Porsche brand would be a bold solution to generating much-needed shareholder value,” Michael Dean, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a note. Porsche’s plan to be almost all-electric by 2030, with the exception of the 911 model, could “attract Tesla-like multiples while generating a Ferrari-like Ebitda margin.” """|investing|Volkswagen is said to weigh listing of Porsche sports-car division|81.0|0.94

$PTON is up well over 500% since debuting on the NASDAQ. Like many tech companies they never turned a profit until COVID-19 hit. For a company like Peloton, COVID was the best thing that could have happened. As gyms shut their doors and locked customers outside, Peloton sales spiked. For the first time since going public they posted a profitable quarter in Q2 2020. They have recently reported record quarterly revenue numbers. 

With all this good, how can I remain a bear?

For starters, Peloton relies on a subscription service to maintain their revenue stream. After the high up-front cost of upwards of $2,500 for the exercise bike, customers turn to a $39 monthly subscription plan.  Far cheaper alternatives exist for consumers.

Planet Fitness offered their members access to iFit last year. Lululemon, a leader in fitness apparel, bought Mirror, the maker of a smart screen for home workouts. Apple ($AAPL), *currently trading at a discount*, recently debuted Fitness+ which offers a far cheaper alternative to a Peloton subscription. Other companies also joining the fitness app sector are Nike, Strava, and Under Armour. Peloton no longer controls the market.

While I'm not nearly as bearish as Simeon Siegel, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, I do agree with his sentiment that $PTON is greatly overvalued. Siegel has claimed $PTON is ""*detached from reality*"" and should be trading in the low $30s. 

If $PTON doesn't diversify, and diversify soon, they may be trading at their all-time high. They're running up against a lot of competition and have yet to fully diversify their offerings.

Peloton as a company is great, $PTON as an investment, not so much. There are better investments out there, don't chase the yellow jersey."|investing|Why I'm bearish on Peloton ($PTON)|39.0|0.78

Tailwinds:

\- Commodity vs gold ratio has started to crunch down signaling commodity boom (copper, lumber, tin, oil, NG, even uranium). Silver, though considered a partial monetary metal, is only going to see increased demand from batteries, solar, EV, medical equipment from here on out. I believe one Tesla Roadster uses something like 1-3 kg of silver. Historical average gold to silver ratio is 40. We are at 66 ish. Mining ratio is 8:1, even lower.

\- Natural elasticity built up from COMEX futures suppression. This is a long topic in itself, but the silver price along with gold price has been ""managed"" for years, with banks like JPM being fined millions of dollars for spoofing (creating massive sells using paper futures triggering cascade of sell stops during thin volume trading hours). However as supply becomes tighter the COMEX is increasingly being used as a method for private family offices, mints, industrials, and hedgefunds to take delivery. The situation is quite dire IMO after the recent ""silversqueeze"" movement- Currently there are about 700 million ounces worth of open contract, with 4 days until March delivery. This number is historically high, and even a small percentage of these contracts standing for delivery (i.e by mints and ETF etc who are feeling the demand) would lead to price volatility.

\- Monetary metal. Due to its extreme utility it can be considered the Etherium or theta to gold, but it is nevertheless still store of value, even though it is not a tier I asset for central banks yet. While gold experiences short term head wind due to rising bond yields, a FED yield curve control policy would dramatically increase tail winds for gold. If history serves, gold and silver have a deep connection and a true commodities bull market is often marked by high gold prices. 

\- Unlike gold, silver has no direct competitor, perceived or actual. Graphene technology is many years away as is space mining. 

Headwinds:

\- Disbelief. Really this is the only head wind I see. Silver has all the properties of gold, and all the utility of something like copper, along with the right price for a value play. If you believe in commodities and inflation, silver to me is a no brainer. That does not mean people won't state its track record as a negative, I realize this. However I rather be in something that has been stagnant for 20 years with all the right fundamentals than something that has been hot for only one month with no fundamentals.

Volcanoes and earthquakes happen, and the longer you go without one the higher the odds of it happening.

Short term outlook:

\- As mentioned the COMEX March contract situation is a developing story. Shorts closing out positions in fear of being asked to deliver will drive up prices. If this happens we can expect 30 dollars in short order.

\- Technical wise, this is bullish with any method you chose to use. It is far above its 200 day MA, unlike gold. It has been making higher lows since December and hasn't neared its Sept low yet. Alot of upwards pressure esp recently, mixed with the aforementioned price smashes.

The plays:

\-There are no physical silver available any where in the world to retail at spot price. That being said physical silver is something I would consider investing in as an adjunct to gold or bitcoin for store of value.

\-PSLV. Sprott physical silver trust. Really as far as ETF's go I'd say this is the safest. Recent changes to SLV prospectus makes one weary about actual physical availability. PSLV trades at a slight premium to spot, however if one was to accumulate 10K ounces worth (\~34K USD at current price) delivery is an option. 

\-Miners. More leverage, more volatility, potential jurisdiction risk. PAAS and AG are larger players. I am deep into many miners. Can discuss if you want. 

\-SLV calls. Again this is for position/swing trading. If you want to invest in SLV as a store of value, I personally wouldn't.

**Field Trip Health Inc** \- US OTC - **$FTRPF** \- CANADIAN - **$FTRP**

When  the company was formed it was through a reverse takeover of a company  called Newton Energy. After completing a going-public merger with a  company called Field Trip Psychedelics Inc, the companies joined  together and became Field Trip Health Inc. (are you still with me?)

Here is the very first Letter of Intent describing the Newton Energy / Field Trip Psychedelics merger.

Here is the juicy part of all of this...

If  you explore the SEDAR files for Field Trip Psychedelics Inc you  discover a couple of interesting names on the Board of Directors.

SEDAR LINK - [https://www.sedar.com/DisplayCompanyDocuments.do?lang=EN&amp;issuerNo=00050368](https://www.sedar.com/DisplayCompanyDocuments.do?lang=EN&amp;issuerNo=00050368)

The first name that strikes me as important is... Dieter Weinand - the current President &amp; CEO of BAYER CORP.

Interesting that the CEO of a $63 billion dollar Pharmaceutical giant is sitting on the board of a small Psychedelics firm.

Then,  I discover another name... Helen Boudreau - the former COO of the Bill  &amp; Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute. She has also worked with  companies like Pfizer, and Novartis, two of the largest pharmaceutical  companies on the planet.

So  anyways, I just thought this was interesting and hopefully we can  discuss Field Trip Health and the psychedelic medicine sector in  general.

The stock is up 141% last 12 months. And still the valuation is low and growing in both revenue and profits every quarter. Been steadily growing revenues and profits since 2013. Beating their previous year every year since then.

I own this stock, 50% of my portfolio actually. I always recommend diversification but I haven´t ever seen such good fundamentals before the market gets it. Which should be in the near future. That´s my guess anyway based on the fundamentals and about 2 month ago there were about 6000 owners of the stock at my broker. Up to 12K owners (Avanza bank, couple thousand more across other brokers)) as of now. So they are starting to getting noticed.

Did a little google mapping today and looks like Academy and Big 5 have very little geographical overlap.  Looking at pictures Academy seems bigger and more spaced out and they have 3-4x sales. Dicks seems to be everywhere, and is the biggest of the 3.

As someone who has been watching VSTO, POWW very closely the past 6 months, retail ammo sales is one of big draws for me, and think this may be their key catalyst for profitability right now.

We keep hearing instore availability is better than online. Bots are constantly watching online stores down to seconds and buying up supply, can't do that with retail shops unless you got an insider. ([Ammoseek.com](https://Ammoseek.com) literally does this for you)

Unlike the 2017/18 rise of Bitcoin, the 2020/21 Bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand.

With institutional demand comes institutional products. We have seen bitcoin derivatives, bitcoin trusts, and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action: publicly traded bitcoin mining companies.

There are two bitcoin mining companies which I'd like to review for you here. Both trade on Nasdaq; they are [**RIOT**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-RIOT/) and [**MARA**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-MARA/).

Lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining.

---

## **What is Bitcoin Mining?**

To mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Mining). The cryptographic combination of the nonce + next block content must be numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target (more on this below). Generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive. There is no shortcut, miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result. They are trying to find the answer to a math problem; a nonce that hashes correctly with the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) (cryptographical hashing function).

The bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every 2 weeks. This is called the [difficulty](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty). The aim is to have a new block mined approximately every 10 minutes. This means that if the mining power is doubled, the difficulty is made 2x harder. Double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin.

We can see an estimate for the [total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate).  Notice that it is about 150m TH/s right now (150 million trillion nonces tried every second). So for every block (every 10 minutes) 9*10^22 attempts are done (90 sextillion) until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can ""mine"" the next bitcoin block. In doing so they get rewarded 6.25 newly generated bitcoin + some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network.

You can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block. In fact, this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done. However, these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin. This is because people have developed special ASIC chips designed specially for brute forcing the SHA-256 function. These chips are a factor of 100 times more efficient than your computer.

---

## **Mining on an ASIC Bitcoin Miner**

The biggest producer of ASIC Bitcoin Miners is a Chinese company called [Bitmain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmain). They produce miners, run many of the miners, and even run many [mining pools](https://antpool.com/) where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits.

Bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin. This is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit.

So lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an ASIC miner today.

The [Antminer S19 Pro](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A) is one of Bitmain's latest machines.  It can run an impressive 110 TH/s and uses 3250W of power. On their website Bitmain is listing them at $3769 per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as $2333 (notice they are sold out until at least August).

So:

* **$2333 machine cost**
* Using $0.08/kWh electricity costs ([benchmark for electricity cost in China](https://www.ovoenergy.com/guides/energy-guides/average-electricity-prices-kwh.html)) we get 3.25kW * $0.08 = $0.26 per hour in electricity costs. Assuming we run 24/7 this gives us $0.26 * 24 * 365 = **$2278 in electricity costs per year**
* And how many bitcoin will we mine? Well at 110 Th/s on an ASIC machine we are capturing 110/150,000,000 = 0.0000733% of the total bitcoin network per machine **at current total hash rate**. 52,560 bitcoin blocks mined per year; 6.25 bitcoin reward per block + ~1.25 bitcoin in transaction fees (avg right now) -&gt; 7.5 bitcoin per block * 52,560 blocks -&gt; 394.2k bitcoin per year for the entire network. 0.0000733% of this is **0.289 bitcoin per machine per year = $14,450 revenue (at $50k per bitcoin)**
* **$14,450 - $2278 = $12.2k profit per year**

You can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels. For example, **if the total hash rate doubled to 300m Th/s, profit per machine would drop to $5k per year.**

Also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin (sending and receiving transactions). See [historic transaction fees](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees). 

And how long can you run a machine for?

Running so many calculations slows a machine quickly. Additionally, new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly. **As a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about 2 years.** This is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet.

In Year 2 the machines become much less profitable than initially.

There have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through IP address analysis of miners working in pools. The University of Cambridge has a [real-time map](https://cbeci.org/mining_map) in which we can see that in 2020 mining was:

| Country    	| % Total Hash Rate 	|
|------------	|-------------------	|
| China      	| 69%               	|
| Russia     	| 6%                	|
| US         	| 5%                	|
| Kazakhstan 	| 5%                	|
| Malaysia   	| 4%                	|
| Iran       	| 4%                	|

## **RIOT and MARA**

Now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works let's look our new investment phenomenon: publicly traded NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining companies.

## **RIOT**

Incorporated in July 2000, the company was renamed to Riot Blockchain in October 2017. The company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with Coinmint LLC in New York who operate the miners. RIOT was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid 2020.

How many miners do they have?

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [11.5k miners in operation and 10k more to be delivered](https://www.riotblockchain.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/99/riot-blockchain-achieves-milestone-of-1-ehs-in-hash-rate) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Oct 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000871/riot_s3.htm))
* In December 2020 their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin ($3-&gt;$15 in 1.5 months). They took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering [raising $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001054/riot_s3.htm). With this money [they ordered 15k more miners for $35m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320001096/ex99x1.htm). Expected delivery starts in May 2021 with the bulk to be delivered in October 2021.

**Summary: 37,640 machines at full deployment. 11.5k machines today and won't be running the rest until Q3/Q4.**

So ignoring the cost of the machines:

* Operational 11.5k machines at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $137m
* Full capacity (Q3/Q4) 37.6k machine at $12.2k profit per year per machine = $459m

And assets

* Maybe $150m in cash/btc left over from secondary offering and past assets


Note: They may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as $0.014 per kwh in some releases.


## **MARA**

Incorporated in 2010, the company has a wild history. It first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium, then real estate in Southern California, and most recently patent trolling. The company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence. In 2019 (I think?) the company began delving into bitcoin mining.

In September 2019 they purchased 6k S9 Bitmain miners (13.5 TH/s) for $4m. Notice that at 13.5 TH/s: these machines are far from profitable today (I'm not even sure they were profitable back then!).

So more recently they own:

* Current status of pre-Dec 2020 orders: [6.5k miners in operation and 30k more to be delivered](https://www.marathonpg.com/news/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) ([funded from $100m secondary offering in Aug 2020](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220014870/forms-3.htm))
* In December 2020 ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from $2-&gt;$14 in a month. [They raised $200m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315220023410/forms-3.htm). With this money they ordered 70k more miners (delivery of 7k in July, 63k in December) for $168m
* In January 2021 they ran yet another secondary offering raising [$300m more](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000864/forms-3asr.htm). They used $150m of this to buy 4.8k bitcoin at $31k per coin

**Summary**

* **Operational 6.5k miners = $79m per yr**
* **Full capacity (Dec 2021) 103k miners = $1.25bn per yr!**

**They also made ~$90m on their bitcoin holdings so far ($150m -&gt; ~$240m)**

Impressive numbers right? Well..

---

## **Too good to be true?**

So what are RIOT and MARA trading at you may ask?

With the recent jump of bitcoin to $50k, RIOT and MARA have rocketed.

* RIOT closed at $77.90 per share, **a market cap of $5.3bn**
* MARA closed at $47.90 per share, **a market cap of $4.5bn**

Investor euphoria is at all time highs. So much so that their price action has rapidly [outpaced](https://i.imgur.com/VjQTaA3.png) and [diverged](https://i.imgur.com/wwzoTn6.png) from bitcoin.

So is it because they have such huge potential? If RIOT gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making $459m per year? And MARA $1.25bn per year!?!

Well, probably not..

* As bitcoin price goes up, mining becomes VERY profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware. From Oct to Dec 2017 the price of bitcoin famously went from $4k to $20k. Total hash rate went up about 60% during this time. [However, it went up a massive 600% over the following 9 months as new miners were produced and deployed](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/difficulty) with a lag.
* As the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money.
* Both RIOT and MARA are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and won't be taking delivery until late 2021/early 2022. What will the network's total hash rate be by then? What will bitcoin price be by then? Chinese miners won't be sitting by idle.
* And we ignored the cost of the machines! In the future RIOT and MARA will need to buy new machines. Regardless of the market the old ASIC miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability. Bitcoin is closed system; There will only be a maximum of 328.5k + tx fees of bitcoin mined per year. In fact, this will reduce in 2024 with the next ""halving"". A company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin/capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same. How many $100m secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch?
* Take a look at the [past financials of these companies](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997320000948/riot10qq3-0920.htm). RIOT mined an ""impressive"" $2.4m worth of bitcoin in Q3 2020. Their costs were $1.3m in electricity/rent/etc. + $1.2m depreciation ($2.5m!). Once you add in their $2m of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of -$2.1m for the quarter. Their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool $385k meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at -$1.7m.
* Of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins Q4 2020 price action. But this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions.


The bull case:

* Bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back. The total hash rate doesn't catch up and $50k btc becomes $1m btc. MARA's $1.25bn revenue next year becomes $12.5bn before ASIC miner production catches up. Investors doubled their money.


Of course, if it becomes so profitable one wonders if Bitmain decides it is better value to use the miner's themselves and breach their contract.

---

## **Tobin's Q**

Simply stated, when you invest in a RIOT or MARA you are investing in the profitability/unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next 1-2 years.

It could be hugely profitable, or it could crash and burn like it did in 2018 and you see no returns.

In this instance, you are paying the executive team of MARA and RIOT to buy the hardware, plug it in, and sell any bitcoin for you. There isn't much more to it than that - you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity.

So perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these NASDAQ companies is the [Q Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%27s_q). The Q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets.

RIOT

* Market Cap $5.3bn
* Current btc miners 11.5k ($27m)
* Ordered btc miners 26k ($60m)
* $150m cash remaining (guess)
* **A whopping Q ratio of 22.4! And 63% of that is cash, 25% in orders!**

MARA

* Market Cap $4.5bn
* Current btc miners 6.5k ($15m)
* Ordered btc miners 96.5k ($225m)
* $240m in bitcoin
* $100m cash remaining (guess)
* **A ""value"" Q ratio of 7.75!**

With this approach, RIOT is trading at a 22.4x premium today and MARA a 7.75x.

A criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged. Just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and won't have most of their machines online until 2022. Is it really worth such a premium?

---

## **Other factors to consider**

These companies have questionable management. **The CEO of MARA has awarded himself [compensation in excess of $300m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315221000469/form8-k.htm) over the last few months. Realise that the market cap of MARA was less than $300m just 3 months ago.**

Both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices. MARA has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from $20-&gt;$48 in the time RIOT has gone from $20-&gt;$77.

A read through both of their 10-Qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims, shareholder class actions, and past investment write-offs due to corruption/shady circumstances.

These companies have no moat. They have no IP. They have no key talent hires. They are simply ordering ASIC miners, plugging them in, and having the biggest pay-days of their lives.

## **Trading strategies**

So is there a trading strategy I would recommend?

### **Bear**

**The challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk/reward is there for betting on the downside.**

Right now the market doesn't care for your fundamentals. Bitcoin has passed $50k, the narrative is that its going to $100k. The market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be 10x higher in a month.

It sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening. It is far too dangerous to be short these stocks. Or worse, short calls and you could be bankrupt on 1 intra-day move.

So that leaves you with puts. Average implied vol nearing 300% does not make them cheap.

If you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads.

Longer DTE plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target.

Another interesting idea would be a relative trade. If you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at &lt;20x premium your long run earnings could net out. However, all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so you'd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some ASIC miners yourself.

More simply you could go long bitcoin and short RIOT/MARA. This should converge in the long run. The risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings.


### **Bull**

Buy as far OTM weekly calls as you can at 400% IV and hope that momentum market continues. Fundamentals are for the 2010s.

---

### **Other**

Both RIOT and MARA's stock price spent some time consolidating down from ~28 to the 16-22 range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial $45k run up back to to $30k.

It is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback. However, the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being.

Ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum/hype/technical and probably retail driven. Long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser. But be careful; that doesn't seem to matter right now.

**Q4 2020 Financial Results**

* Shopify **beat EPS estimates by $0.35** by generating GAAP EPS of $0.99 and **beat revenue estimates by $64 million** by generating $977 million in revenue
* Shopify had a monster 2020 with **annual revenue growing by an incredible 86%** which in large part is due to the COVID pandemic as stores moved digital and new entrepreneurs came to the scene
* The company’s platform showed incredible resilience and stickiness as the company continued to **grow its monthly recurring revenue at an annual 49% over the past 5 years**
* **Customers spent $119.6 billion dollars** on Shopify platforms which is up an astonishing **96% year over year**
* Perhaps even more impressive is that the company is maintaining all this growth while improving their margins, **reporting operating leverage of 39% in 2020 vs. 53% in 2019**
   * This was due to the huge uptick in 2020 revenue and further proves that the company has great product-market fit + has established itself as the go-to eCommerce platform for self-starters

**Why the Stock is Down**

* Since these numbers are so great, you may be wondering why Shopify stock fell today by \~3% (but as much as 7% intraday)
* First, as you can see from the [latest stock price chart](https://www.google.com/search?q=shopify+stock&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS744US744&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00-F5N0A4a0B01WOaVAkOiu1p_BQA:1613621430747&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=fin&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGvbmhyPLuAhVYxYsBHU6PC8EQ_AUoAXoECCAQAw&amp;biw=1923&amp;bih=946#scso=_uegtYMqOEa3KmAW5xbiYDw7:0), Shopify had a really strong build-up towards earnings because **investors were expecting a monster quarter** \+ the stock market was just on fire
   * This is further represented by the 48.3x next twelve months sales multiple Shopify was trading at as of last Friday ([sourced from blog Clouded Judgment](https://cloudedjudgement.substack.com/p/clouded-judgement-21221)\- highly recommend to anyone interested in Cloud to sign up for this guy's newsletter)
* The second reason Shopify stock is down is **conservative guidance.** The company acknowledged that its 2020 growth rate is unsustainable and stated that it expects a more **“normalized pace of growth” for 2021**
   * Investors probably weren’t surprised by this but since the company didn’t provide aggressive guidance, it seems many investors took profits off the table and sold shares
* Third, just yesterday, **Amazon** completed its purchase of Australian-based Shopify competitor Selz
   * The acquisition was announced a month ago, so I don’t think this was a primary reason but I do think it is a notable factor for two reasons:
      * First, Australia is an extremely important market for Shopify, with management expressing it as a core market in the latest earnings call
      * Second, of course is just that Amazon is a terrifying competitor and may be encroaching onto Shopify’s territory

**Earnings Call Highlights**

* Throughout the call, most of the discussion was about how the company’s financial metrics are all pointing upwards and how eCommerce is growing like crazy but we already covered that stuff, so I’m going to focus on two main takeaways from the call
* **The first takeaway are the four key trends management believes will shape the new Shopify era**
   * **The first is that consumers are voting with their wallets**, meaning that people are buying products that represent their identities rather than focusing on utility
      * To take advantage of this trend, Shopify launched its mobile app SHOP last April, which is a shopping app where you can purchase from brands on the Shopify platform
      * Personally, I like the idea but I think there’s an incredible amount of competition in the shopping app space so I’m not super bullish on the app yet
      * Also, when asked for more tangible figures on the app’s performance, Tobi Lutke, Shopify’s CEO pretty much dodged the question probably because the numbers are great enough to publicize yet (which is fair since it's a pretty new product)
   * **The second trend is that retailers are prioritizing retention** and in response, Shopify is continuing to build out services that make the customer experience easier, such as Shop Pay which provides accelerated checkout and Shop Pay Installments which lets customers pay in portions instead of all at once
   * **The third trend is the growing popularity of modern financial solutions**
      * The company highlighted its Shopify Capital offering, which provide merchants with short term loans which they can pay back with their sales, Shopify Pay Installments, and Shopify Balance which lets merchants open business accounts
      * To me, its clear that Shopify is trying to be a one-stop shop for everything a merchant needs, which I think will help grow the company’s total addressable market
   * **The fourth trend is the power of omnichannel,** which is the ability for businesses to be on multiple platforms
      * Shopify has established partnerships with some of the best marketing channels and I believe this trend will only continue
* **The second key takeaway from the earnings call is the 3 areas the company will be investing into in 2021 and will be sources of future growth**
   * **The first is the Shopify Fulfillment Network** which the company launched 18 months ago and is currently under beta testing
      * If you’re not familiar with fulfillment, basically it allows merchants to not have to physically manage inventory themselves and instead Shopify would have huge warehouses that store your products and ship them out when orders are received for a small fee per item
      * I think this is a great complement to Shopify’s services and think this will be a great area for future growth
   * **The second main investment will be on the Shop App,** which I mentioned a bit earlier already and am cautiously optimistic of
   * **The third investment will be on international expansion,** and management stated that international GMV grew at a faster pace than overall GMV
      * GMV = Gross Merchandise Volume and is basically the total $ amount spent on Shopify platforms
      * This is obviously a great sign and Shopify has such a great product that I think there is a lot of room for growth in other countries
   * **The fourth bonus one that management tacked on was Shopify POS** **(point-of-sale)**, which competes with Square as an offline retail transaction system

**My Personal Experience With Shopify**

* I used Shopify for \~2 years as a merchant selling clothes and have nothing but great things to say about the platform. Shopify is so much more than just a company that lets you create an eCommerce site. The services I personally also used are:
   * **Shopify shipping** \- The company gives competitive discounted shipping rates that made it cheaper for me to fulfill myself vs. fulfillment centers (which we also used and are able to offer discounted shipping rates since they ship so many items)
   * **Shopify apps** \- There's an app for everything and a really strong ecosystem of developers who are motivated to make good apps since they earn $$
   * **Shopify POS** \- Before COVID, I held 2 physical pop-up shops and used Shopify's POS system. The only competitor I was considering was Square but Shopify's POS connects so well to everything I already set up on my store (i.e. inventory, pricing, etc.) that there Shopify POS was a no-brainer
   * **Shopify Customer Service** \- This may be the best part as a budding entrepreneur. Shopify service is AMAZING and I was able to call a representative pretty much anywhere at any time for help with my site

**Buy, Hold, or Sell?**

* I think if you're already a buyer, then there's for sure no reason to sell and I would hold for the next 5+ years.
* But for me, I haven't yet initiated a position and while the company's valuation is high (\~48X forward sales), the company's growth rate, sticky platform + recurring revenue, and dominance in a growing eCommerce market provide plenty of upside
* Personally with interest rates having gone up and a potential shift out of tech growth stocks (just my personal opinion), Shopify is one of the stocks I'm keeping a close eye on and hoping to buy during any corrections
* I'd love to get some opinions from you all on what you plan to do since I'm pretty torn myself on what to do

**TLDR: Shopify crushed earnings growing revenue at an insane 86% from 2019-2020. But shares slightly dipped by 3% due to high investor expectations + conservative guidance for 2021.

SweetWater Brewing Company is a craft brewery founded in 1997 by Freddy Bensch and Kevin McNerney in Atlanta, Georgia. SweetWater's beers are unpasteurized and distribution is limited to select states

SweetWater recently annouced that their beer will [be available in 27 states with Western Expansion](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005247/en/SweetWater-Brewing-Company-Reaches-New-Heights-Launching-Statewide-in-Colorado-February-1)

&gt;SweetWater’s expansion into the first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana comes shortly after its [November 2020 acquisition](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-inc-announces-strategic-entry-into-the-united-states-with-an-agreement-to-acquire-sweetwater-brewing-company-301166616.html) by Aphria Inc

Irwin simon, the CEO of Aphria, has a track record for aggressive expansion. He brings a unique background who specializes in M&amp;As. Aphria’s recent acquisition of SweetWater was a strategic play to expand into US &amp; more importantly, creating brand awareness. 

&gt;We will establish and grow our U.S. presence through SweetWater's robust, profitable platform of craft brewing innovation, manufacturing, marketing and distribution expertise. At the same time, we will build brand awareness for our adult-use cannabis brands, Broken Coast, Good Supply, Riff and Solei, through our participation in the growing $29 billion craft brew market in the U.S. ahead of potential future state or federal cannabis legalization

**US Trademarks**

Aphria proactively filed US Trademarks for a number of their brands:

[Broken Coast](https://uspto.report/TM/90383411)

[Riff](https://uspto.report/TM/90383302)  

[Solei](https://uspto.report/TM/90383374)

Irwin is leveraging SweetWater's existing infrastructure to accelerate Aphria's entry into the U.S. ahead of federal legalization of cannabis to fuel sustainable profitable growth. Aphria will be positioning itself as a top tier brand in the US through SweetWater.

**Broken Coast Brew** - *The best of the bud in the best of the brews*
&gt;Inspired by the one and only Broken Coast, these small batch craft brews will have you saying “woah”. Packed with incredible earthy, dank and complex cannabis-inspired flavours you’ll feel the sea breeze in no-time. (Pg.25)

**RIFF** – *Loud without the cloud*
&gt;Not for the un-inspired, RIFF’s brew masters bring the house down. Hoppy, flavorful and aromatic our lineup brings the party to wherever you are. Join us in this joint effort and run the show with these flavour-packed brews. (Pg.26)

**Solei Hard Seltzer** – *it is always sunny with Solei*
&gt;There is no time to enjoy the sunshine like every time. Solei’s hard seltzers are created with the perfect combination of freshness and crisp flavours. Made with sun-kissed fruits, Solei Hard Seltzer brings the sun all year round. (Pg.27)

I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Solei concept featured on SweetWaters newly released [Premium Hard Seltzer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005211/en/SweetWater-Releases-Oasis%C2%AE-Premium-Hard-Seltzer) at some point.

In addition to its traditional distribution footprint, SweetWater 420 Extra Pale Ale and IPA are served on all Delta flights nationwide plus internationally totaling more than 50 countries across six continents which has served to extend SweetWater's brand reach on both a national and international level. The Company also hosts an annual music festival, ""SweetWater 420 Fest,"" that has evolved into one of the largest and most anticipated music festivals in the U.S., increasing brand awareness nationwide.

This move creates a branded cannabis lifestyle Products Company with a diverse revenue base. I strongly encourage everyone to look into the management on both sides and come to your own conclusions.

Stay safe &amp; GLTA!

Origin Materials just announced a merger with Artius Acquisition Inc. (AACQ), a SPAC launched in July 2020 with 725M$ in equity. Origin Materials has “exceeded our high bar for investment” (taken from) Artius plans to fund Origin Materials until they are EBITDA positive (HUGE IMO).

Fortunately for us, Origin Materials is not some crappy company with no sales. No, they already have over 1BN$ of customer demand from large companies such as Pepsi, Nestle and others.

**About Origin Materials:**

**Overview:**

“Founded in 2008, Origin is the world’s leading carbon negative materials company with a mission to enable the world’s transition to sustainable materials; patented breakthrough platform technology for producing recyclable and sustainable materials makes “net zero” possible.”

**Beginnings:**

Origin started with an idea: What if we looked for potential where others had given up trying — and changed the world? In 2008, chemical engineering students from the University of California, Davis founded a brand-new material technology company. Ever since, Origin has applied first-principles thinking to challenging, rewarding problems in chemistry and engineering. R&amp;D is our heart and soul.

**Platform development:**

Over the past 10 years, Origin has developed a platform for turning the carbon found in biomass into useful materials, while capturing carbon in the process. The science has steadily advanced, from initial proof of concept to pilot demonstration and beyond. In 2016, Nestlé Waters and Danone formed an alliance with Origin to commercialize the platform’s first product, plant-based PET plastic with a low carbon footprint. PepsiCo joined the NaturALL Bottle Alliance in 2018. Today. Now, we are developing and commercializing our core technology, including building a small commercial-demonstration scale facility. It’s how we’re making our vision reality: We believe that in the future, making products won’t be an emissions problem – but an opportunity to capture carbon in durable goods.

**Tomorrow:**

Plans for the future are already underway.

Origin Materials is currently operating with a number of pilot plants, with plans of opening many more in the future. Their first large scale plant, Origin One, is anticipated to be ready for production by 2022. Origin Two will be much larger than Origin One and will be their first commercial scale plant, it is expected to be ready in 2025. In 2028 they are predicting to have four plants making over 2 billion dollars in revenue every year. Origin forecasts a revenue of 830$ million by 2026.

**TLDR:**

Origin takes inedible plant/biomass wastes such as wood chips, cardboard, rice hulls, cotton trash, pulp waste and more, and turns them into either 5-chlolomethyl-furfural (don’t ask mans what it means, just sounds mad good) and Hydrothermal Carbon, both can be turned into various products such as -Textiles and fabrics -paints -filler for tires -solid fuels -agriculture products

Origin already plans on building plants (of course not the green ones you eat ) and is predicted to make good money.

**Investment Highlights:**

**Addressing Enormous and Growing Materials Economy :**

Core products are carbon negative drop-in replacements serving a \~$1Trn+ market – with diverse applications expected to deliver growth for years to come

**Industry Disrupting Technology Supported by Deep Competitive Advantage :**

Conversion of biomass feedstocks into drop-in chemicals, competing directly on cost with fossil-based materials while having significant advantage over alternative technologies

**Global Fortune 500 Customers and Investors:**

\~$1Bn1 of signed customer contracts and \~$400Mn of customer contracts under negotiation

**Funded to Effectively Scale and Commence Commercial Production:**

Executing on growth plan with first plant expected to be completed in 2022 and contracted portion of first two commercial plants expected to be 100% sold out in 2022. Full-scale commercial plant expected to be online by 2025

Experienced Leadership Team with Proven Track Record: Brings a team of industry veterans and technology leaders with \~250 years of cumulative experience – ready to deliver on its vision and operational priorities

**Political backwind:**

The huge over $1Trn market potential is further consolidated and supported by the current political push for a net-zero carbon emission plan.

”As president, Biden will lead the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example, by ensuring the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.” (THE BIDEN PLAN FOR A CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE)

Currently most of the attention and hype has been around green energy and infrastructure and has been neglecting the actual material and product manufacturing aspect, which is more than necessary in order to reach a carbon neutral state.

Origin, with their carbon negative manufacturing plans, perfectly fill the gap and fulfil the need for carbon neutral/negative manufacturing of products such as paints, soil additives, epoxies, plasticizers (aka: everything around you my guy).

**Finance and all that other stuff with numbers:**

Origin expects to deliver a superior financial profile for years to come

**Anticipated fully funded growth plan to profitability:**

Current transaction is expected to be sufficient to fully finance the construction of Origin 1 and Origin 2 and achieve EBITDA profitability

CapEx based on estimates from world-leading EPC companies that Origin will partner with to deliver holistic capital project solutions

Capacity scaling based on current customer contract commitments / orders and anticipation of demand from global industrial complex rushing to secure “drop in” decarbonized materials to meet their carbon commitments

**Valuation:**

$1,843Mn pro forma equity value of combined company

$999Mn Enterprise Value, implies 1.2x 2026E Revenue and 3.4x 2026E EBITDA

Earnout of 29.5Mn shares vesting equally based on share price thresholds of $15, $20 and $25 per share within 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively

**Capital structure :**

Origin Materials shareholders rolling 100% of their equity

Transaction, inclusive of $200Mn PIPE financing, expected to result in $863Mn of cash to balance sheet, anticipated to fully fund company’s operations and capital expenditures until EBITDA positive

**Ownership :**

42.4% existing shareholders; 46.7% SPAC shares; 10.9% PIPE investors Ownership

1. Sellable Story

Look you may not like it but an important part of having a stock rise a good amount comes from how much attention it is going to get from potential buyers, and the more democratized the market gets the more important this is. Most fucking people aren't scraping through the bottom of the barrel to find random stocks. They're listening to the news, reading forums, and seeing what company everybody is talking about and then choosing to buy it. This means that the more you have that stock talked about the more potential buyers you have - Don't believe me it's literally just the logical extension of the Cramer Effect.

So what Schwab's sellable story - The flood of retail investors. In case you live under an actual rock, retail investors just like you are popping up like crazy, and since everybody has got those sweet sweet stimulus checks and have only been saving for months due to the lockdown, they all got money burning a hole in their pocket. Not to mention everybody is bored so what do you do that gets the blood pumping when the most movement you get is when you walk from your bed to your desk each day? You grip it and rip it on stocks. Don't believe it look at Schwabs January 2021 Activity Report:

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_jan2021\_press\_release.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_jan2021_press_release.pdf)

They added over a million new accounts in January. That's an insane number. Now I know what your thinking, but they added 14 Million in October and 1.2 Million in May! Yes that's because they acquired TD Ameritrade and USAA's investment arm in those months, this is an organic million which is bonkers. They added on a whole USAA in a month organically.

2) Financial Outlook

If you want to see how they have been doing here is their past financials:

[https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw\_q4\_2020\_earnings\_release.pdf](https://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/about-schwab/schw_q4_2020_earnings_release.pdf)

I'm not explaining it all get over it, but basically they've been growing like an Australian fire.

What I want to look at is how these financials will look like in a year, and to do that you have to understand one of the major ways that Schwab make its money. When you open an investment account you dump all your little coins in and you buy stock right. Well the thing is even though you put in all these coins most people don't use them all - in fact on average they leave 12% in cash in the account. Schwab then takes this 12% and invests and keeps the profit, this sort of capital acquiring strategy has been making people rich for years. This does mean there is risk if their investments go badly, in fact this is why they lost some growth in revenue in 2020, its not because they didn't grow as a company, it's because the ""safe"" investments that a firm would take with this sort of stuff got wrecked all over and stayed pretty bad during covid, now its pulling back up though.

So what does this mean - well basically the more people you have with brokerages account the more money you can invest thats why this flood of investors is huge. Further this isnt some temporary jump in investors retail investors have been flooding the market for years and they arent leaving, because people so rarely close their investment account unless you really try to get rid of them (cough cough robinhood). This mean that they have a flood of customers that are going to stay for a long time. This is good because the older you get the more money you put into your account (on average), and according to Schwabs Winter report 53% of their clients are households with a head of house hold less than 41 and they're typically rich. This means that over time this bump will keep paying out big.

All of this combined and the bullish technicals mean only one thing - a huge earnings. Now I could go on but I've gotten kinda bored writing this but if this is well responded to I'll give a full analysis including the financials and the technicals.

BlackRock’s Rick Rieder told CNBC on Wednesday the world’s largest asset manager has begun entering the bitcoin space.

The remarks from Rieder, who is BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, came on the same day bitcoin broke above $51,000 for the first time.

“Today the volatility of it is extraordinary, but listen, people are looking for storehouses of value,” Rieder said on “Squawk Box.” “People are looking for places that could appreciate under the assumption that inflation moves higher and that debts are building, so we’ve started to dabble a bit into it.”

In January, BlackRock added bitcoin futures as an potential investment for two of its funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The funds are BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities and BlackRock Global Allocation Fund.

A number of other financial institutions, such as BNY Mellon and Mastercard, have made entrances into the crypto space in recent days. BNY Mellon, the nation’s oldest bank, will launch a digital assets unit later this year, while Mastercard intends to support certain cryptocurrencies on its formal network.

Electric vehicle maker Tesla also announced last week it bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin using cash on its balance sheet and intends to begin accepting the digital coin as payment for its products.

The price of bitcoin has risen more than 70% this year, adding to a major rally that began in the fall. “My sense is the technology has evolved and the regulation has evolved to the point where a number of people find it should be part of the portfolio, so that’s what’s driving the price up,” Rieder said.

Despite bitcoin’s growing respectability as an asset class, Rieder said Wednesday that how much exposure an investor should have “depends on what the rest of your portfolio looks like.”

“We’re holding a lot more cash than we’ve held historically,” he said. “It’s because duration doesn’t work, interest rates don’t work as a hedge and so diversifying into other assets makes some sense. Holding some portion of what you hold in cash in things like crypto seems to make some sense to me, but I wouldn’t espouse a certain allocation or target holding.”"|investing|"BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is starting to ""dabble"" in Bitcoin"|3641.0|0.97

Is useful to go and check the last meeting expectation in December and watch how does it change, right now 97.9% is expecting that the federal reserve is going to keep the interest rate at 0-25(in bps) range and 2.1% is expecting an increase to 25-50 points.

I'm curious what the opinion is of people opening positions during these highs versus waiting for a slight correction.

If an investor anticipates the correction 3-4 months from now, does it make sense to go in now or in 3-4 months? The momentum seems to continue across the market, stocks getting super pumped. There are even travel stocks that are HIGHER than their highest of highs before the pandemic.

My assumptions may(or 100%) be incorrect.

* Typically when interest rates are lower; stock market performs well. This is typically due to more cash in people's hand resulting in more spending. Which translates to companies performing well.

Currently with interest rates so low and business struggling to meet ends., Does it make sense to have 70%-30% mix in a portfolio? Or is there any alternative investment vehicles that is better than debt but less risky than equity(to replace 30%, 70% will still be in equity).

I put together the handy table below to look at the 6 largest US Airlines with market cap of at least 5B.

The goal was to see where they stand today, how they fared last year compared to each other and how close to fully recovered the stock is to pre-pandemic levels.

&amp;#x200B;

||**MKT Cap**|**2020 Loss**| **EPS** |**1-1-20**|**Today** 	 |**% &gt;1-1-20**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|DAL|28.475B|($12.4B)| \-19.49|$55.74|$44.65|24.84%|

&amp;#x200B;

For me right off the bat, I'm a pass on DAL, UAL &amp; AAL given the massive 2020 losses and the hideous EPS.  Next, it seems LUV and ALK are already almost fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  This leaves me to to consider JBLU for a potential 20% gain in the next 3-6 months at minimum.

Many of us feel like there is a lot of pent up travel demand.  I believe the vast majority of that travel will be domestic and leisure.  JBLU has not depended on international travel or business travel nearly as much as some of it's competitors.  CEO has stated they are 80% leisure travel as of mid last year. I think this sets it up well.

Additionally, they have a fairly new partnership with AAL that was approved by DOT last month despite pressure by United to halt it. - [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-jetblue-partnership-173205155.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-jetblue-partnership-173205155.html)

Finally, they have a loyal customer base (as does LUV) and were just voted No. 1 in Economy Class, No. 1 in Inflight Entertainment, No. 2 in Business and First Class (for Mint), and No. 2 airline overall. - [https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/](https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/)

What I was surprised to see was a complete rebrand of the Playboy we grew up with, and at the time, under $13, and they just returned public late last week.

Tipranks and other analyst forecast show this stock as a moderate buy with a LOW 12 month forecast of $18/share. ([https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/plby/forecast)) (Other forecast models show the same data). That seems great, but there were only 2 analyst ratings on it so I didn't get excited.

Today PLBY Group announced their new CFO, Lance Barton, formerly of Match Group. For anybody who doesn't know, here is the TD article on him:

&gt;PLBY said Mr. Barton, who served as head of corporate development and investor relations for Match, led the acquisition of more than 30 companies over his 13 years at the dating-services provider and IAC/InterActiveCorp, its former parent, including Match's recently announced $1.7 billion acquisition of Hyperconnect.  
&gt;  
&gt;PLBY returned to the public markets last week after completing its combination with blank-check company Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp.

It's too early to analyze earnings reports, as there are none, so I went on a hunt for competitors (I didn't go too hard in the paint looking past Adam &amp; Eve who are not traded publicly), but what I did find was through their website and instagram have HARD shifted focus to apparel, much along the lines of Victoria's Secret, publicly traded under L brand at:

Closing Price **$49.21** Day's Change **1.99** **(4.21%)**

Today PLBY hit a high of around $16.50 and closed out just under $14 (I bought in 22 @ 12.99) and from my research, I feel this brand has room to grow and support the analysis given by experts on a ""moderate buy"". Also, all this change was done under what TD says:  Volume (Light) **2,560,573**

So I'm not entirely sure how a higher volume would affect this stock.

The Apple stake reduction left Berkshire with a holding valued at US$120 billion at the end of 2020, according to another filing.

Berkshire spent the last three months of the year revamping its bets on some other sectors.

So stick with me here… Stamps.com (STMP)

**TLDR: Stamps.com isn’t really a business that sells stamps online, it’s a SAAS company that’s quietly become the backbone of eCommerce fulfillment by acquiring businesses such as ShipStation, ShipEngine, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, MetaPack, etc.**

**Overview:**

From my experience when someone hears Stamps.com they immediately think ""people don't send letters anymore"" and figure the business is on the same path as your local blockbuster was. Thing is, around 10 years ago Stamps.com management must have realized this as well as they started acquiring tons of SAAS companies in the eCommerce industry.

What people don’t realize is that today, they’re about as pivotal of a player in the eCommerce space as anyone else out there. So if you’re long eCommerce, you probably want to go long STMP.

**Ecommerce 101 - Multi-Channel Sales &amp; Fulfillment:**

Generally speaking, most brands that sell online do so through a variety of channels.  You have your first party channel (direct to consumer) via your own website likely built on Shopify, Woocommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento (bless your soul), etc

Then you also likely sell via third-party marketplaces like Amazon, Wayfair, Etsy, eBay, Overstock, etc. The list goes on and on.

The process, at its core, is pretty simple. When someone orders your product from Amazon.com, Wayfair.com, or even your own website someone needs to pull the units from the warehouse, pack it up in a box, and then ship it to the customer. Simple enough.

When selling somewhere like Amazon, everything is for the most part contained in their ecosystem via something like the FBA program. They hold the inventory and manage the fulfillment process from start to finish. However, when you’re selling multi-channel, it’s a whole different beast. Obviously, Walmart.com isn’t going to be cool with your product showing up to the customer's house in an Amazon box with a smile on it. They also won’t hold your inventory in their warehouses or ship it for you, that’s all on you.

Due to this, online sellers generally work with multiple warehouse/fulfillment providers. These are called Third Party Logistics providers (3PL’s) and they not only store the inventory but also “Pick, Pack, &amp; Ship” the products to the customers.

As you can imagine, when you have orders coming from a variety of different marketplaces, being placed by customers all around the country/world, and you’re working with a variety of fulfillment centers across the map… it’s a heavy lift. Thus, managing all of this requires software solutions that integrate everything together. Enter Stamps.com

**Imitate Zuckerberg. Buy Everyone.**

If you didn’t know, Stamps.com owns ShipStation, ShippingEasy, ShipWorks, ShipEngine, Endicia, and a variety of other hugely popular shipping and logistics platforms used throughout the eCommerce industry.

If you sell online it’s pretty likely you’ve used one of their solutions to manage your shipping/logistics. For example, everyone knows Shopify but if you go look at the most installed/most reviewed shipping apps on Shopify you’ll see some familiar names: ShipStation, ShipWorks, and ShippingEasy. Same thing if you look at the most popular eCommerce shipping software somewhere like G2 Crowd or Capterra. Stamps.com doesn’t just own one of the players in the space, they own 3 of the top 5 players.

Stamps.com also owns a pretty cool company called ShipEngine.ShipEngine is basically the eCommerce shipping API, think stripe but for shipping. The ShipEngine API allows connections to over 30 different shipping providers (UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL…) in North America, Europe, and Australia. This allows you to not only instantly get shipping labels for orders but also compare shipping costs and rates in real-time.

Need to ship a 12x12x6 box that weighs 3 lbs to a customer in Orlando? ShipEngine can help you determine that it’s best to route that order to your Atlanta warehouse 3PL and ship it via FedEx to save $4 compared to the second-best solution. Now a 10x6x4 box that weighs 1 lb headed to San Diego? Route it from the LA warehouse, ship via USPS, you get the picture. It’s a pretty robust solution and used by some pretty big players, for example, Facebook Marketplace and Facebook Shops both use the ShipEngine API for managing all their label printing, shipping, etc ShipEngine makes money every time someone compares rates, prints a label, validates an address, uses order tracking...

**It’s A Sticky Business**

First off it’s pretty obvious owning a SAAS company is a better business model than reselling postage at a small markup. It doesn't cost a lot to add another user account to your software and honestly, once you've integrated something into your logistics tech stack, you're gonna need a REALLY good reason to change it out because it’s a pain in the butt.

This gives Stamps.com an insane amount of price elasticity. In addition to this, once you start taking market share in this industry it causes somewhat of a flywheel or snowball effect.

For example, eCommerce sellers use ShipStation so they want to work with 3PL’s that understand and have integrated ShipStation into their operations. Due to this, the 3PL’s themselves are motivated to adopt ShipStation into their tech stack as well. Now when a new eCommerce seller is looking into what solution to use, they see all the warehouse providers are using ShipStation so they go with that as well. It’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This long-term inertia and stickiness are likely why the monthly pricing on solutions like ShipStation are so low.  Once they “own the market” they can pretty much raise the prices to whatever they want and the customers won’t go anywhere.

Personal Anecdote: Hopefully someone else who's in the eCommerce industry can back up some of the stuff I’ve mentioned above but just for some background I’ve been in the “ecom” space for around 10 years. Founded a few startups, two of which were acquired over the last 5 years (I’m not talking unicorn level acquisitions btw, more so acquired by PE firms doing roll-ups and stacking EBITDA kind of level.) That said I currently work as a managing partner for a portfolio company that owns/operates a handful of consumer brands that drive a substantial portion of their top-line revenue via third-party marketplaces so I’m in this space 60+ hours a week on the strategy side. All of this is just to say that I know we aren't switching any of our brands off ShipStation, even if they 10x their prices. Also, when you own the actual API (ShipEngine) that your competitors are building their software solutions on top of, you’ve essentially built a monopoly in the first place, how much of a competitor are they really if you don’t want them to be...

**Boring Financial Stuff**

So one of the reasons I think Stamps.com doesn’t actually mind flying under the radar is due to the fact the company is already printing money. Not often are SAAS companies, growing at a crazy pace, in a booming industry, actually generate a ton of free cash flow and sitting on excess cash on their balance sheet. If you’re like most growth companies in the SAAS space you’re operating at a loss. You need to “hype” your business up to keep your share price high so you can issue shares and generate cash for operations, a simple game.

When it comes to STMP that’s not the case. Looking at Q3 2020 alone, STMP generated $194 million in revenue (compared to $136 in Q3 2019.) Additionally, their profitability skyrocketed as well from $9 million in Q3 2019 to $64 million in Q3 2020. A combination of the jump in eCommerce as a whole and the natural margin expansion you’ll see while transitioning from a reseller of postage to a SAAS provider. This left them with a ton of excess cash on the books at the end of Q3, sitting on nearly $400 million.

When you start looking at their valuation it’s pretty obvious wall street hasn’t quite caught on to the shift in their business model from reselling stamps to being a profitable SAAS company in the eCommerce space which seems to have a pretty nice macro tailwind behind it.

Trading at a PE ratio in the low 30’s and a PS ratio around 7, even moderate growth trends make it seem cheap. This is only compounded by the fact that you’ve got other players like Shopify trading at PE ratios of 900+ and PS ratios of 70+.

**The Cherry On Top**

So one of the main reasons I wanted to get this DD published so I could reap the karma if what I’m about to lay out here actually comes to fruition. The earnings report is Wednesday so wanted to make sure I got this posted prior to that call.

One reason I believe Stamps.com trades at such a low valuation is due to the fact that the company's name is literally, Stamps.com. It’s probably the same reason some people opened this thread ready to laugh at whatever they thought this DD was going to be about.

That said, I think the name might actually be changing soon which could be the start of a rebrand of the company to not only wall street but the public as a whole.

Stamps.com acquired the trademarks to Auctane back when they acquired ShipStation in 2014 as that’s the original holding company name for ShipStation. If you search Auctane on Google you won’t really find much but that’s due to the odd fact that they’re actually blocking google from indexing Auctane.com via a robots “noindex” tag on the domain. Here’s a screenshot but you can obviously check the source code yourself. [https://i.imgur.com/4tMd6EA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4tMd6EA.jpg)

Until September 2020, Auctane.com was just redirecting to the homepage of ShipStation but as of a couple of months ago there’s a brand new website built out that encompasses the “brand” for all the eCommerce software solutions they own and you start noticing it being mentioned in randomly press releases as a “parent company” signing leases on office etc.  You can see when it was updated on the Wayback machine here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201115000000\*/https://auctane.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201115000000*/https://auctane.com/)

Obviously, this in itself doesn’t mean anything but it seems a little suspicious that they would be blocking Google from indexing the website. I wouldn’t be surprised if they spin out all the eCommerce focused SAAS companies to the Auctane parent or potentially even rebrand the entire company as a way to shed the stigma of just selling stamps online.

**Wrap-Up:**

I could probably write out 3 more pages explaining what I believe to be some of the competitive advantages they have in the space but I'm lazy and hopefully, this is enough to at least get the conversation rolling on why wall street may be fundamentally looking at the company wrong.

IMO they’re poised to be the solution for global multi-channel e-commerce shipping and fulfillment. If they changed their company name to something other than Stamps.com my guess is the street would be throwing cash at them like there's no tomorrow.

**My Current STMP Positions:**

**IB:** [**https://i.imgur.com/FiW2JV5.jpg**](https://i.imgur.com/FiW2JV5.jpg)

**“Why Should Anyone Listen To You? What Credentials Do You Have?”**

From an investing standpoint, literally none. I’m not an investment professional, investment banker, analyst, etc. That said I’ve worked hand in hand with most companies that service the eCommerce industry over the last 10 years. From building on xcart to thinking Magento was the bee’s knees at one point in time. Obviously just working in an industry doesn’t mean you’ll know what companies to invest in, that said I do feel like I have, to some degree, an insider's perspective on the direction of the industry more so than someone from the outside looking in. For example, I think my only other post in this sub was recommending Shopify back when it was trading at $27 a share haha: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4i760h/if\_you\_had\_4000\_to\_chuck\_into\_a\_single\_stock\_for/d2vzhxl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4i760h/if_you_had_4000_to_chuck_into_a_single_stock_for/d2vzhxl/)

**TLDR: Stamps.com doesn’t sell stamps. They do, but that’s not their actual business model. If you want to invest in a rapidly growing SAAS player in eCommerce that isn’t trading at an insanely high valuation, maybe it’s time to start collecting stamps.**"|investing|$STMP DD - Stamps.com's Real Business Is ShipStation &amp; ShipEngine|31.0|0.88

1.  The company was spending aggressively on expanding, developing and marketing the 5G network during much of 2019 and 2020  

2.  Until the conference call in November of 2020 there was no one on the BOD addressing shareholders returns. 

3.  Previous to the current CEO (Ku Hyeon-mo) there were some allegations against the former CEO Hwang Change-gyu about the appointment of advisors.  

4.  During Covid the last thing investors were thrilled about seeing was a company spending money.  

So to sum up, the current CEO (Ku Hyeon-mo) has continuously expressed his interest in returning value to shareholders through increasing the dividend and utilizing buy backs, as well as possibly cancelling the bought back shares.  In the last few conference calls the BOD has distinctly stated they are committed to decreasing spending.  All of the allegations against the former CEO have fundamentally been laid to rest.  He is also dedicated to exploiting growth in the lucrative AI, data and cloud sector, as well as increasing the profit driven areas of KT Corp.'s portfolio.

Stock Price as of 15th Feb: $17.29

Current Mkt Cap: [projected a $1.3b](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/24/2132624/0/en/Metromile-a-Leading-Digital-Insurance-Platform-to-Become-Public-Company.html) \- they only just went public and I think their previous 570m cap was from INAQ thus incorrectly reported.

TLDR at the very bottom. My position is 76 shares @ $18.26. It's all I have spare right now as all my other long funds are tied up in BB and NIO, but plan to load up more at the end of the month.

# Who are MetroMile?

Quick explanation: MetroMile are a digital pay-per-mile insurance company that are starting to massively disrupt the market with a strong focus on AI, machine learning and user experience.

**Longer description from MM themselves:**

&gt;Metromile is a leading pay-per-mile car insurance company in the U.S. Recognized by Forrester as a top insurance carrier in user experience, it is creating a loyal community of drivers with personalized insurance that is customized to each driver to be more affordable. Powered by machine learning and customer-centric design, Metromile is at the forefront of disrupting a more than $250 billion personal auto insurance industry that has gone unchanged for decades. Through Metromile Enterprise, our software-as-a-service business group, we license our proprietary artificial intelligence claims platform to automate claims, reduce losses associated with fraud, and unlock the productivity of insurance carriers’ employees so they can work on higher-impact experiences.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re a diverse team that combines Silicon Valley’s best technologists with veterans from Fortune 500 insurers and financial service institutions. This approach ensures that we’re as equally focused on loss ratios, unit economics and profitability as on customer experience and technology innovation.

**Market disrupting InsureTech, driven by AI, machine learning and a strong focus on transparency and user experience - why does that sound familiar?**

That's right. When life gives you lemons, you make a disruptive AI based home/rental insurance company called LEMONADE that has blasted off to $163 a share. And when life gives you Lemonade, you take that model and apply it to the pay-per-mile car insurance market.

*(if this is tricky to read on mobile, they are forecasting hitting +$3.1m in 2022 and then rocketing to +$87m in 2023 and +$225m in 2024)*

# How good are the team behind it?

Full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from [MetroMile's website](https://www.metromile.com/about-us/) and not my words, but they looks impressive.

**CEO Dan Preston:**

&gt;*Joined Metromile in 2013 as Chief Technology Officer before becoming Chief Executive Officer in 2014. Under his leadership, Metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. The company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. Metromile has been voted a Best Place to Work by Glassdoor and the Phoenix Business Journal.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Prior to joining Metromile, Dan was the co-founder and CTO of AisleBuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by Intuit in April 2012. He has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.Dan holds a master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision from Stanford University and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Brandeis University, where he received the Michtom Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science and graduated Summa Cum Laude with highest honors in Computer Science.*

**CTO Paw Andersen:**

&gt;*A technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. He was most notably a senior leader of engineering in Uber's Advanced Technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. Beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies.*

**And then Founder &amp; Chairman David Friedberg, the below is what I have accumulated from researching Wiki, the NY Post and Linkedin:**

&gt;*Former Google employee. The thing that stands out to me is that he was the FOUNDER and CEO of the Climate Corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1B sale to Monsanto in 2013. The Climate Corporation (now known as Climate Field View) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. From nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health &amp; vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. This guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data.*

# Expansion, Opportunity and Catalysts

* They are currently operational in **just 8 of 50 U.S. states**; Washington, California, Oregon, Illinois, Arizona, Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
* They plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and **49 in 2022**
* Those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with MetroMile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing **$160B in potential premiums** (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck I linked, jump to slide 30)
* The IPO transaction has provided an estimated **$294 Million in cash** to pursue growth opportunities
* They are looking to **expand and cross sell into other verticals** such as; Homeowners, Renters, Pet, Warranties &amp; Maintenance through 2021-2022
* They are **licensing their leading AI claims platform** and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below)
* They are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and **one of them is** [**FORD**](https://www.fintechfutures.com/techwire/metromile-and-ford-team-up-to-bring-highly-personalized-car-insurance-to-ford-owners/), they expect **8 by 2022** so keep an eye out for announcements
* There are ambitions to go global
* In December they provided a Q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146566/0/en/Metromile-Raises-Policies-in-Force-and-Contribution-Profit-Expectations-for-Full-Year-2020-Provides-Update-on-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Metrics-and-Reaffirms-Outlook-for-2021-20.html)), we should be due Q4/2020 final numbers soon

# NOT just an insurance provider - FinTech LICENSING Growth

This one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims AI platform they've built? They are now LICENSING that through their [MetroMile ENTERPRISE](https://enterprise.metromile.com/) arm of the business, and its **built to work on top of standard claims management software**.

* This licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly YoY ($12.4m in 2021 &gt; $21.7m 2022 &gt; $33.7m in 2023 &gt; $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $MILE as an insurance disruptor, they are also **a** ***software/technology company***
* It seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their Enterprise tech at this time but do list Tokio Marine, a ""Top 10 US Carrier"" and a ""US Carrier"". They say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline.

# What about the competition?

On a technology level, the closest form of competition I can see is [Root](https://www.joinroot.com/test-drive/), however their USP is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. It utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. MetroMile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile.

Lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical.

On a business model level, Mile Wise (from All State) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $MILE from what I can see.

# The world and our habits have changed, $MILE are poised to grab that by the horns

* A pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included
* In the UK, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road ([Source](https://www.gocompare.com/motoring/reports-statistics/coronavirus-travel-report/)), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual *(YES...I understand $MILE is a U.S. company, unfortunately I could not find any U.S. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world)*
* A survey shows after the pandemic **25% of drivers** plan to drive less: [Source](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-8260957/A-fifth-motorists-claim-theyll-drive-lockdown.html) *(sorry, another UK source I know but I couldn't find similar for the U.S., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees)*
* OK...so as I was typing I found this which shows **US mileage dropped by as much as 60%** during the height of the pandemic last year: [Source](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/06/851001762/the-pandemic-emptied-american-roads-but-driving-is-picking-back-up?t=1613224790884) \- the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends
* **22.7% of employed Americans** were working from home in September due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/americans-are-driving-less-than-before-pandemic-and-it-s-permanent)
* When the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations.

Before the pandemic was a thing there was STILL a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $MILE to the forefront quicker. Ready to expand.

Do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? Some may, but most will not. People like convenience and ease of use. New habits will stay.

# Cons/Watch Outs

* The move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally I don't think this will be an issue because 1) I just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as I said COVID19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness.
* The insurance goliaths (i.e. Geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (I am not based in the U.S. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - I don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $MILE are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $MILE have but you can't rule Buffet/Geico out
* Someone like Lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector

This is not a swing trade, this is not that P&amp;D shit, this is a buy early, hold and ride the wave of a growing company built on great tech, a great team and a great business model. Here's your TLDR; read it properly and actually make a decision for yourself because I feel this is a sleeping giant just waiting to explode.

$INAQ's share price jumped from around $9 pre SPAC announcement in December to around $17 today. However since completing the merger on Wed 10th Feb 2020 and the ticker renaming to $MILE the price has barely moved, dipping a dollar or so and maintaining pre merger completion levels. I feel like the market are really sleeping on this and they are flying under the radar so I am getting in now before they reach their potential.

**Intro:** Over the past few years, natural gas has been in the dumps. Usage has been going up as it's been displacing coal and exported as LNG, but prices for the commodity have been low. When companies are drilling for oil and that pays the bills, natural gas is effectively a waste product. For companies who have gas only wells, this is a problem. You need to make the business payout with a product that other people consider to be a by-product.

**My thesis:** With COVID and the growing ESG inevestment movement, funding for energy companies has cratered. Fracking for oil has declined, and with it all the associated gas that has kept natural gas depressed for so long. Oil companies have found it difficult to raise new capital for drilling and need to generate it organically by making money on their existing business. ([https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/)). All of a sudden gas wells need to be economic only on the gas part and there isn't enough being produced. Rig counts are way down, but natural gas for export to Asia, Europe and for Coal to Gas switching is going up. The last few months of winter also drew stocks down past the 5 year average. Canadian natural gas pricing is the best it's been in at least 3 years, and it's getting better, up over 200% from where it was in 2019. Demand is coming from LNG, and US imports. [https://boereport.com/2021/02/16/resurgent-canadian-natgas-producers-look-to-edge-in-on-u-s-market/](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/boereport.com/2021/02/16/resurgent-canadian-natgas-producers-look-to-edge-in-on-u-s-market/?utm_source=daily*20digest&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=daily*20digest*20email&amp;utm_term=d_prabihf&amp;uc=C8m6HtV&amp;dc=Poff8e6&amp;utm_content=digest-story__;JSUl!!IiPVToYj!fqxo_V6Hu3w8TwVBW_xUaehxMfDkwF0Suvin67j_yJsAukbN3urkW8GYfqrzgu9z_Cc$)

Gas exports have been on the rise for the last few years and domestic US usage was down last year due to COVID / warmer weather. This has hidden the structural shortage (7-8bcf / almost 10% of supply) and kept prices down while storage is getting drawn down. U.S. fracking companies have a lot of debt due in the next few years so they need to keep any cash flow to pay down debt as their access to credit has been extremely reduced. This could usher in an era of higher prices, where prices that traditionally caused more supply to come online are used to repay debt and repair past excess. For companies that have low costs and good balance sheets, this will be a huge opportunity.

**The Play:** Peyto Exploration is one of the lowest cost, mid sized producers in the world. They are incredibly lean, having staff of less than 50 people, while generating production larger than companies with 10x the staff. [https://www.jwnenergy.com/article/2021/2/9/peyto-comstock-among-lowest-cost-north-american-ga/](https://www.jwnenergy.com/article/2021/2/9/peyto-comstock-among-lowest-cost-north-american-ga/) They have been beaten down and are just coming off their lows (Look at a 5 year chart).

They have cheap acreage and have reduced their production costs significantly over the years. Canada has been strugging with infrastructure issues and this has caused Canadian gas companies to trade at a severe discount to US companies, with CDN natural gas often times trading negative for long periods of time. It makes it hard to run a profitable business...but Peyto did it for the past 3 years in all but the worst quarters of the pandemic. This has created an industry that is lean and can weather the storms of the past 4 years. NGTL 2021 expansions has taken care of these issues and Canada is finally seeing consist pricing close to world pricing. This is a value play of a depressed company trading well below book value, the company is forecasted to generate over $200M or &gt;$1 / share in free cash flows with current natural gas futures pricing. They are incredibly responsible with capital and have a history of paying out a dividend. They paid a $0.72/Divvy as recently as 2019. **The company has over $8/share in infrastructure, $25/share in reserves and $7/share in debt. That reserve value is based on much lower pricing assumptions than what the market is currently pricing. This is a value reset play, the market is just taking notice.**

This is a beaten down company (look at a 5 year chart) that has been suffering with local pricing issues that are no longer there. People have noticed in the last 2 weeks, but this thing has still got legs. They are returning to historical production and as the cheapest will be producing ""gobs of cash"". The real story here is that Canadian Gas prices have recoupled with US prices so the discount in pricing is gone, at just the time when pricing is going up in general (Futures curve up 50% YoY).

The CEO also publishes a monthly news letter and is extremely transparent. They have been meeting their operational goals and are just turning the quarter. [http://www.peyto.com/Files/PMReport/2021/PMR2021Feb2.pdf](http://www.peyto.com/Files/PMReport/2021/PMR2021Feb2.pdf)

Tl,dr: One of the lowest cost producers of natural gas, with a low float, low price to book, and trading at a 30% yield to free funds flow. Long term hold if you like dividends or just want a turn around growth stock. 

N.B. This is my own research for educational purposes only. This is not investment advice, **I just really like the stock.** I am LONG Peyto Exploration and have followed the company and the space for years.

1613493203.0|0.0|t3_ll7lpj|28.0|"I’ll start by saying this post is intended to solicit feedback on longer term portfolio holdings.  My core equity holdings are slightly overweighted to longer term factors of higher expected returns: mainly value, small, profitability/quality and momentum in a more passive way. I hold broadly diversified low cost Vanguard, BlackRock, and Dimensional ETFs.  I speculate with “fun” money but the serious money is all long term.

4 years ago that core portfolio enjoyed strong mid and long term outperformance relative to a neutral market index.  The last three years however, especially 2020, wiped out lots of that relative outperformance though absolute returns were still strong and inline with historical expectations. It’s been disappointing but still good. 

A few data points I’d like to get everyone’s perspective on:

Growth vs. Value - June 2020 was the worst 3 year rolling period for value vs growth spreads ever observed.  The 10 year trailing return on growth is well above its historical average while value is about in line with its historical average. What does this mean over the next 5-10 years?

Low Profitability Growth - 2020 marked high watermark years for both Large Growth Low Profitability companies and Small Growth Low Profitability Companies (~88% and ~57% respectively.  Small Growth Low Profitability typically doesn’t out perform Small High Profitability (across sectors too) over most time periods let alone by the magnitude we saw last year. Are expensive names with low profits (some negative profits) going to continue this run? Are the few winners in that subset enough to overcome the losers in that space moving forward (not every name will be the next big thing)?

It’s different this time - I’ve heard the argument that intangibles and the “new economy” justify value being “dead” and that low rates are helping fuel this.  However intangible property in growth names isn’t that much different than levels in the past. Will the music stop right when Covid get under control and inflation shows up again?

FAANGS - they drove market growth and beat up on value in the last decade. What were your return expectations of these firms in 2010? Did you assume +30% annualized growth for these names a decade ago? Even firms like Amazon and other FAANGS that aren’t going anywhere, do you expect them to continue their market cap expansion over the next decade?  Amazon would be larger than the current total US market cap in 8 years at this rate.  

ARK - 2020 was a gang buster performance year. My best guess is their factor loadings are growth, small, low profitability, and momentum, which all hit for the cycle last year, some of them at historic levels.  Disrupters and innovation is not a new phenomenon. Is this just perfect sequence timing?  Will those factor weights revert to more historical averages in the coming years? What will help them keep the winning needles in the haystack?

Is now a good time to rebalance back to a Value/size/quality mix (also Ex-Us)?

Does anyone care about fundamentals and valuation anymore? When do you abandon an approach?  Stocks underperformed tbills for 18 years in the 70s but the market premium wasn’t dead. Value trailed growth over 19 years in 2000 and reversed that by 2001. Small caps got killed by large caps throughout the 80s.

3. Market Overview / Competitive Landscape
4. IPO Details
5. Financial Analysis
6. Valuation / Key Risks

**1. Business Model**

*What does Loop do?*

Loop designs, manufactures, sells, and services hydrogen fuel cell systems for the electrification of commercial vehicles. Its near-term focus markets include light/medium trucks (e.g. home delivery vehicles), semi-trucks, buses, and other commercial vehicles (mining, etc), with long-term plans to expand into other intermodal transport (marine, rail, etc).

*What is its product offering?*

Loop’s key products are fuel cell stacks (stacks of fuel cells that produce electricity and water when supplied with hydrogen and oxygen) and fuel cell modules (fuel cell stacks along with the balance of plant - all the necessary equipment to operate) and has manufacturing facilities in British Columbia, Canada, and Langfang, China. Loop believes that through its proprietary eFlow technology, its fuel cell systems are superior to its peers in terms of fuel efficiency, durability, and power.  We expect these characteristics to be key differentiators as Loop and its competitors race to secure OEM relationships and achieve mass-market adoption.

*Understanding the current landscape and Loop’s competitive advantages*

On the path to transitioning the global fleet to zero-emissions vehicles, Loop sees the current lithium-ion batteries as only a part of the solution, with its hydrogen fuel cells creating significant advantages over the existing solutions in terms of range, payload, and refueling times. Loop markets three key benefits to its fuel cells, compared to competitors, which we think well-position the company to continue to lead its industry. In addition to the technical competitive advantages which are outlined in the *Competitive Landscape* section, we see Loop’s industry positioning is supported by Cummin’s investment and its partnership with OEMs.

*Growth Strategy*

The company has rapidly developed its business development pipeline, forming partnerships with OEMs and building a relatively small revenue backlog of $16.4 million to date, with plans of significantly expanding this over time. The company expects that the larger OEM suppliers will be in a position to launch commercial vehicles with fuel cell systems between 2025 and 2027, meaning the company’s near-term focus should be on manufacturing fuel cell vessels in smaller volumes and developing its technology and backlog. Loop also has a JV with InPower in China to establish a manufacturing line. We think Loop’s stated strategy (below) is well-aligned with the most important objective - becoming the dominant player in the industry.

*Loop Growth Strategy*

1. Focus on commercial vehicle market and leverage products into other markets
2. Scale manufacturing and customer support infrastructure
3. Develop partnerships with leading OEMs and OEM suppliers
4. Reduce costs by leveraging scale and internalizing certain components
5. Continue to invest to develop and improve eFlow technology

**2. Management, Board, and Ownership Overview**

Loop’s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries, including fuel cell development and automotive development (key relationships at strategically important OEMs). The company also appointed two special advisors with excellent track records leading companies: Lord John Browne (BP, Riverstone) and Lance Uggla (IHS Market, S&amp;P Global). With its recent additions, we view Loop’s management team and board as a strength.

The current and pro forma ownership of the company is included below. Upon completion of the offering, there will be a concurrent reverse stock split, consolidating 3 shares into 1 share, which is noted below, along with the forced conversion of convertible debentures, reflected in the table below:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Beneficial Owner**|**Fully Diluted Current Ownership (post-consolidation)**|**Pro Forma Fully Diluted Ownership** (assumes $115mn allotment at $16/share)|

|**Total**|**27.3mn (100%)**|**39.6mn (100%)**|

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Market Overview / Competitive Landscape**

*Industry Overview*

The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow at a 39% CAGR, from \~$2.6bn today to $50.8bn. Hydrogen fuel cells are the most widely adopted form, with significant investments from governments and corporates to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen. The hydrogen market is expected to represent \~€10 trillion+, with countries representing \~70% of the world’s GDP introducing hydrogen strategies (including US and Russia).  While this is clearly a growing, attractive and strategic market, we do note that many industry data sources provided by management are sponsored research, including the Hydrogen Council.

We see electrification as an important global trend as countries and companies commit to decreasing emissions, with a target of net-zero by 2050.

Loop’s competitors include Ballard Power, Beijing Sinohytec, Horizon Fuel Technologies, Hydrogenics Corporation, Hyundai, Nuvera Fuel Cells, Plug Power. Powercell, and Toyota. Despite this strong group of competitors, Loop’s technology provides significant competitive advantages, noting that competitors pose a significant risk for the company (see *Key Risks to Loop’s Valuation)*

*Competitive Advantages (per Loop)*

* Fuel Efficiency - efficiency improvements enable greater savings and higher return on investment
   * According to Loop, the incorporation of fuel cells into battery electric vehicles increases range by 2.5 to 3 times
   * 16% lower fuel consumption vs. competitors, generating \~$300k in fuel savings over lifetime
* Higher Peaking Power - provides higher payload capacity and range
   * \&gt;50% more peak power than top competitor and &gt;90% more peak power than most competitors
* Durability - results in lower service and maintenance costs
   * Up to 10x better current density uniformity

**4. IPO Details**

*Overview of the Offering*

Loop issued its preliminary prospectus on February 5, 2021, announcing plans to raise \~$100mn (+15% greenshoe option) at an \~$12-$16/share valuation. Shares are expected to price the week of February 15, 2021 and trade the week of February 22, 2021. The IPO will be led by National Bank Financial. Per filings, the net proceeds are expected to be used for R&amp;D, capital assets, and other expenses.

Funds from the strategic financing will be used to further accelerate the company's product development activities, project deployments, and growth plans as it expands its technical leadership in medium and heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell bus and trucking applications.

*Share Count*

Loop’s current fully-diluted share count pre-IPO is \~30.0 million shares, and pro forma for the offering will increase to \~39.6 million shares (assuming shares price at the top range of indications and the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option).

*Previous Equity Raises*

Based on Cummin’s prior investments in the company and current shares owned, Cummin’s cost basis is \~$4.32/share.

**5. Financial Analysis**

*Revenue* was \~$350k for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, primarily representing the sale of demo field and test bench units. This will increase as the business continues to develop its product backlog, noting Loop’s definition of this figure represents estimated sales, including conditional agreements and MOUs. We view the development of this product backlog and execution to be a key risk, as this backlog may or may not actually materialize.

*Product Backlog* as of January 31, 2021 represents revenue of $16.4mn, up from $4.3mn as of December 31, 2020.

*Operating Expenses* \- the company expects to achieve gross margins of \~30% and EBIT margins of 20% by 2030, supported by its eFlow technology, which the company expects to reduce manufacturing costs. We think that Loop’s approach to design in-house and expand vertically along the supply chain will be beneficial to achieve best-in-class margins. Given the significant size of the addressable market, economies of scale, and importance of reaching the “tipping point” for mass-market adoption, we expect significant M&amp;A in the near-term. We also expect strategic M&amp;A to be viewed favourably by the market with the understanding that despite near-term dilution, these types of transactions should be accretive to long-term value.

*Capital Structure -* pro forma for the offering, Loop’s balance sheet will substantially change, with the majority of its debt (convertible debentures) converting into shares, leaving Loop with an essentially debt-free balance sheet.

&amp;#x200B;

|**($ millions)**|**30-Sep-20**|**Adjustment**|**Pro Forma**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|(+) LT Debt|0.8||0.8||
|(+) Convertible Debentures|3.6|(3.6)|–|Converted|
|**Total Debt**|**4.4**|**(3.6)**|**0.8**||
|(-) Cash|6.3|115|121.3|IPO proceeds + conversion of warrants and options|
|**Net Debt**|**(1.9)**|**(118.6)**|**(120.5)**||

**6. Valuation / Key Risks**

*Market Valuation*

We expect shares to price at the top range of the $16/share IPO price, valuing the company on a fully-diluted basis at \~$513mn. At this valuation, we see tremendous long-term upside if the business is able to execute on its plan (see multiples valuation below)

&amp;#x200B;

|Shares Outstanding (mn)|39.6|
|:-|:-|
|Stock Price ($)|$16.0|
|**Market Cap ($mn)**|**633.6**|
|(+) Net Debt|(120.5)|
|Enterprise Value|**513.1**|

*Multiples Valuation*

While it is difficult to value the business today, we (and Loop) expect the fuel cell market for commercial vehicles to significantly expand in the next few years, with OEMs ramping up production for commercial launch by 2026. The market for fuel cell electric vehicles is expected to grow to \~$7bn in 2026.

Working backwards from this, if Loop grows to a \~$750mn revenue business with 20% EBIT margins (2026 EBIT of $150mn) and a 15x EBIT valuation (in line with current valuation multiples), this would imply a &gt;$2.2bn enterprise value in 2026. Discounting this back to today at a 15% cost of equity still results in &gt;$1.1bn of value, offering &gt;2x upside. We also think this 15x multiple is conservative given the growth potential of the industry and potential for Loop to become a leading market player.

Using this same methodology, 2026E revenue of $200mn - $400mn at a 15x EBIT multiple backs into the $12-$16/share range today.

*Key Risks to Loop’s Valuation*

* Inability to grow business development pipeline with OEMs or translate pipeline into revenue-generating contracts
   * The current pipeline represents $16.4mn, which includes conditional agreements and MOUs; the key focus of the business is expanding on this pipeline
* Existing and new competitors developing a more attractive, more widely adopted product offering
   * While Loop’s positioning is protected by patents, technological advantages, and Cummins backing, OEMs with substantially more capital and may enter the space and compete
* Technological risk of more attractive technology rendering Loop’s technology and offering obsolete
   * Emissions technology continues to advance and there may be a new form of technology that will reach mass-market adoption, replacing hydrogen fuel cells
* Large-scale manufacturing execution
   * While Loop’s management team has experience building out manufacturing, the company (and its competitors) have yet to execute on the large-scale manufacturing required to meet expected future demand

- Today the 10-year Treasury rate shot higher, to a level comparable to the panic last March when people were dumping everything they could to raise cash. 

- This has matched a melt-up in equities and crypto-currencies, as well as the SPAC craze.

- Treasury yields are rising despite the fact that the Fed is apparently still buying bonds at a massive rate from primary dealers 

- Inflation expectations rising rapidly, Fed has said it will go over 3 percent

- Washington continues to deficit spend like nobody's business

- It's always trendy to talk about the ""bond bubble"" but I haven't seen any of these articles in awhile even though the reasons for owning bonds at these yields defy logic

Potential Risks:

- (Perennial) - China dumping U.S. Treasuries 

- Higher Treasury rate = higher mortgage rates, decrease in home values + many delinquent mortgages due to pandemic

- Does increasing yield on treasuries mean that Washington is increasingly going to be paying out higher amounts of interest on its deficit spending?  Could this lead to a credit downgrade? We know a low rate is good for stocks and real estate, but is it also good for a government that's unable to dig itself out of a fiscal hole and in fact keeps digging deeper?

CVS is currently at $74 (MKT Cap of $97B) while Aetna ended at $212 (MKT Cap of $70B). It seems surprising that CVS stock hasn't really recovered from the initial merger (decline in stock around the purchase) when the Aetna was the 3rd largest insurer at the time.

CVS is currently running at a lower PE Ratio of 11.46 and their Free Cash Flow is up \~20%TTM. Competitor insurance companies are priced at

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit Friday morning and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. [Here is the first flight to space that demonstrates the technology.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8T9mVkGh3s)

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Key Staff and Players:**

Founder - Sir Richard Branson: Founder of the Virgin Group (Virgin Mobile, Virgin Atlantic, etc.)  
CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

**Noteworthy Investors**:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America  
Morgan Stanley  
ARK  
Boeing  
Chamath Palihapitiya (Also a Virgin Galactic Chairman)  
Cathie Wood (presumably through ARKK)

**Partners**:  
Boeing ( investor/hopes to be a part of the hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

1613434006.0|0.0|t3_lkqxju|29.0|"With a day off today I thought I’d post some DD on an under-the-radar biotech company that I think has great upside potential:

**What is TLC?** Taiwan Liposome company is a biotech focused on making lipid-based nanoparticles.  

**Why TLC?** ***The Science:*** As a nano-scientist, I can tell you the thing I’m most excited about in terms of nano-innovation in the healthcare space is lipid nanoparticles. Their application is in drug delivery, and this is a HUGE field. One of the main issues pharma companies struggle with when identifying a suitable new drug is that a significant proportion of the drugs are hydrophobic. This means as soon as they enter the body they get cleared by the body’s immune system and never end up reaching their target. Lipid nanoparticles solve this issue by encapsulating the drug in a lipid shell, which has a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic interior. They essentially hide the drug from the body’s immune system and are able to shuttle the drug to its destination by whatever targeting moieties are also attached to the surface of the particle. Lipid nanoparticles are behind the delivery of mRNA in both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Background aside, here are some highlights that make me excited:

* They have a number of drug candidates based on their delivery systems BioSeizer® and NanoX™ in their pipeline in some great growing markets: their current focus is in post-op pain management. Particularly, TLC590 is poised as an alternative SAFE pain-management injection to help curb the opioid crisis. In one of their studies, 58.3% of patients in the TLC590 475mg group remained opioid-free through the entire duration of the study.
* Two of their candidates (TLC599 and TLC590) are releasing top-line data or entering phase III this year. TLC599 could achieve 26% usage in the US as an injectable steroid and will release phase III results in 2H2021.
* TLC has 156 patents worldwide and 87 applications in the pipeline.

***Business/financials:***

* TLC has a strong management team of 5 with 2 PhDs, an MD and 2 MBAs.
   * CMO was the VP and Clinical Head at Pfizer.
   * CBO did business development &amp; licensing at Johnson &amp; Johnson and Amgen
* Financials aren't too shabby for an up and combing biotech:
   * Their revenue growth has grown enormously over the past 4 years and a whopping 235% from 2018 ($62m) to 2019 ($209m) and is currently sitting around $100m for 2020. 
   * Their EV value is $188.94m, lower than its market cap of $236m, and its current EV/revenue value is 1.85.
   * NT$479.4m more liquid assets than total liabilities.

***Analysts' opinions:***

* Current consensus is a BUY rating with an average price target of $12.75. It is currently trading at only $5.66. 
* Laidlaw set a price target of $16.

**Why not TLC?** TLC isn’t the only company making lipid-nanoparticles, all the big pharmas are as well as many other smaller companies so there is a lot of competition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on all the above, I think this is on an upward trend and will see great growth potential in 2021+. 

**TLDR: Micro cap drug delivery company with great upside potential with phase III data on non-opioid pain management drug releasing later this year. Current price of $5.66, average price target of $12.75.**

One possibility is that ""innovation"", for the case of investing in them, refers to the company/firm's potential to create new product or services to enter the market, or even creating an entire niche market entirely. But how exactly do we quantify it? At least to me it seems like these funds (and myself) are basing it on news and articles, which imo are all opinionated and subjective. Shouldn't we be basing it on hard facts or some form of quantitative research?

P.S. Apologies if this sounds like a rant but I'm genuinely confused by the state of things! Hopefully someone has found a solution to this problem! Thanks a bunch in advance!"|investing|"Investing in ""Innovation"""|12.0|0.71
1613427715.0|0.0|t3_lkosfu|94.0|"TORONTO — Bitcoin-based exchange traded funds are getting the go-ahead from Canadian regulators, creating a path for a fund structure that investment managers say is unique in the industry.

Toronto-based Purpose Investments says its Bitcoin ETF will likely start trading this week under the symbol ""BTCC,"" after the fund worked with regulators to make sure it could create something that follows the rules for both the ETF market and the digital asset industry.

An Ontario Securities Commission spokesperson says the regulator finished reviewing Purpose Investments' final plan to offer securities last Thursday and gave the fund a receipt that makes it a reporting issuer in Ontario.

After Purpose Investments announced the milestone, another Canadian fund, 3iQ, said it also received preliminary receipts for a Bitcoin ETF in all of the Canadian provinces and territories except for Quebec.

Both funds claim to be ""physical"" Bitcoin ETFs, setting them apart from some of the other cryptocurrency investments out there, such as the Bitcoin futures that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Purpose Investments Chief Investment Officer Greg Taylor says the fund is different from a derivative or futures contract, as Purpose Investments will buy Bitcoin every time someone puts money into the ETF.

Taylor says Purpose Investments will also store the Bitcoin codes themselves, not on the internet, using a process called “cold storage.” OSC has described cold storage as ""a computer with no access to a network” that is less vulnerable to hacking.

Purpose Investments says the end result of these Bitcoin ETFs is that investors will hold actual Bitcoin in their portfolios but can buy and sell it similarly to buying or selling a stock.

""The risk is for traditional investors that you have to open up a trading account to buy Bitcoin and you’re in self-custody — meaning you’re going to get the code and password for that coin. And you’re responsible for doing that,"" says Taylor. ""With the ETF structure, it’s going to be easier as we’ll do that with our custodian.""

CIBC Mellon is working as a fund administrator for Purpose Investments' Bitcoin ETF, as the firm looks for ways to meet rising demand for cryptocurrencies.

Ronald Landry, who runs Canadian ETF services for CIBC Mellon, says it is working on getting more cryptocurrency services up and running in Canada.

3iQ chief executive Fred Pye says a physical Bitcoin ETF is the natural progression from its other investment vehicles, which include a publicly listed Bitcoin investment fund and a fund based on cryptocurrency Ether.

Launching those past funds was not an easy feat.

3iQ had to argue before the Ontario Securities Commission to get approval several years ago for its trust that would ""invest substantially all of its assets in Bitcoin."" But that 2019 decision stopped short of signing off on an ETF structure, which the OSC decision said would have to undergo separate analysis since ETFs “require continuous purchases and sales to balance and rebalance the portfolio frequently and daily.”

At that time, the OSC said, there were two ways to hold Bitcoin, either by directly purchasing it in a digital wallet or investing in securities of companies or other entities that held Bitcoin, such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, available to ""accredited investors” through a small number of Canadian institutions.

While regulators initially tried to deny 3iQ a receipt for its earlier Bitcoin trust over concerns about the ability to value and safeguard Bitcoin and file audited financial statements, a 2019 ""foundational"" decision allowed it to move forward.

""Some novel asset classes and securities products fail. They become tulip bulbs or dot.com's. Others succeed and become gold or the next great technology. Securities regulators are not mandated to try to pick winners and losers,"" that decision said.

Pye said in a statement that 3iQ considered their closed-end fund to be a ""success” as the company moves into the ETF space.

Digital currency brokerage Coinbase says the price of Bitcoin has surged 368 per cent in the past year and 23 per cent in the past month, and at midday Monday sat at $61,443.79."|investing|Canadian funds move forward with Bitcoin ETFs after regulatory jockeying- update|94.0|0.85

While important, high valuations are a necessary but not sufficient conditions for a bubble.  Said another way, high valuations are one side effect of a complex disease. We can't diagnosis or understand the severity of the disease without knowing more.  Here's a list of other important bubble related issues.  What do you think?  What did I miss?  Do you think we're in a bubble?

* Animal Spirits matter and they're the hardest to measure.  Especially since we're all biased.  I'm a pessimist when it comes to the market ... I tacitlly believe people think like me. When I see these valuations, my first thought is BUBBLE ... Remember, there's alot of optimists out there thinking FREE MONEY.  Know which you are, correct your view and try to be objective. Also know that optimists will turn into pessimists (vice versa), but it takes time/data to change someone's mind.
* No binary thinking.  Nothing in the world is black or white; the market is not up or down.  I see a lot of comparison to the dot com bubble.  No one seems to bring up the fact that prices climbed and then hung at or around record highs for the better part of a year.  Yes we're probably in a bubble, but its reasonable to think we'll hang here for a while. The upcoming year has brighter prospects than the previous one.
* Most times there isn't a catalyst for a crash, even in hindsight.  Don't drive yourself crazy looking for one.
* Know the story. While it's true it's hard to find the catalyst, know the story of your potential bubble.  IMO, it's interest rates in our current case. COVID caused many people to look to the future and writeoff the present.  They were enabled by low interest rates.  Investors funneled into future looking companies which, by definition, were less harmed by COVID and relatively more attractive in a low rate environment.  We all must watch the rates and the yield curve.  This may not be the catalyst, i.e. not likely to have one large rate increase/yield curve steepening that will crash the market.  But inflation will grow, rates will grow slowly and then eventually, the story may unwind.

A lot of my thoughts stem from Robert Shiller's work. He's got great short books on these subjects.  Recommend Animal Spirits to start.

Finally, stay sane and solvent.  If you're going short, use options ... When you buy a put you at least have defined risk bounds ... Same is not automatically true for shorting."|investing|A more complete look at crashes/bubbles|340.0|0.9

ROE (Return on Equity) aka Net Income / Average Shareholders' Equity

People love throwing out ROE numbers to get you to love whatever they are pitching, but you should be automatically suspicious of ROE as a headliner number.

ROE can be written another way: ROE = ROA x Financial Leverage.

ROA is an **operating** metric.

Financial Leverage is a **capital structure** metric.

So ROE is a blended metric of both: operations and capital structure.

This is significant because when you are comparing two competitors and think that one with a higher ROE is a better value play that may be a mistake. 

Those two hypothetical companies may have the same exact ROA but company A may just have borrowed heavily, which will jack up ROE. No change in business model, operations, efficiency, etc, just a simple increase in debt will make your ROE go up, even if you just sit on the cash and don't use it.

Remember, debt is risky for equity holders, no guarantee that a company will use it for productive projects. This risk is further compounded in a near zero rate environment.

ROA is a more relevant metric if you are commenting on the core business model.

At best, ROE without context is a distraction. At worst, it can be downright misleading.

Happy Investing!

1613418313.0|0.0|t3_lkldt4|20.0|"Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,   who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant   transposition of truck plans ready for production.

FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?

After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite – something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.

# I.  The Team

First,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.

​

&amp;#x200B;

***The Allstars*** ***-***

**James (Jim) Taylor** – 35+ years experience – CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company’s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as “The Great One” when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim “The EV Man” Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.

**Jason Luo** – 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company’s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.

**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google’s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers’ new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called “High-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments”. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop – one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.

**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company’s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS’s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.

**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  &amp; Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).

**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs – Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &amp;  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.

**David Boris –**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&amp;A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.

​

***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***

***Jerry Hu***  – 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**

***Justin Prann*** – 15+ years – CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.

***Kev Adjemian*** **–** 20+ years – CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&amp;D leadership at **Nissan.**

***Albert Li*** – 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.

***Benjamin Wu***  – 15+ years – GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&amp;A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.

So  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.

# II. What Does ELMS Do?

Now  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:

▪First and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.

▪Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production

▪Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later

▪Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1

▪Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China

Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note – this is from December so it may have changed some since.

​

The  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.

A cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :

▪ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery

▪ One warranty single point of contact for customer

▪  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.

I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.

​

Next,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :

▪Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles

▪Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance

▪Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports

▪Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons &amp; software add-ins

Some  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.

&amp;#x200B;

# III. Sales and Financials

The  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.

ELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.

The ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. “Our team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.”

I  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being “contingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.” As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.

​

​

**\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*

*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.

*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County – it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that “One-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.”  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated “Fairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.” Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.

​

Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state’s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company’s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.

Another  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, “Rivian’s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,” Taylor said.  “If you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That’s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. “Coming  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,” Taylor said.  “Supplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.”  Well, that's a  bargain.

The institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:

▪Alpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.

▪BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ▪Phoenix Holdings Ltd – 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)

▪Bank of America – 70k shares (\~$1mill)

▪Toronto Dominion Bank – 15k shares (\~$203k)

▪STA Wealth Management – 13k shares (\~$176k)

▪UBS Group – Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)

We also have in the past month:

▪Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.

▪P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.

▪Gabelli &amp; Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.

▪Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.

I  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.

As  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.

Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :

▪No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches

▪Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022

▪Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market

▪Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025

# IV. The Indiana Factory

​

Another **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says “ELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.” The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.

Another  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production – workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.

In  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world’s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    “In addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering – from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  – and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,” said  James Taylor.

ELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs“ELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.”

Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.

# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection

Ok,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.

**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**

This  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!

One thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding “bad reviews” from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.

Seres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.

**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**

Well,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.

# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?

The  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: “Is this a Chinese company or not?”

**The short and easy answer is NO.**

**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**

**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**

Sokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. “Hey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it’s  American,” he said. “Our  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    “You’ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I’d say  there’s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,” Taylor said. “But  after we’re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we’re like  everybody else. I’m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.”  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.

# VII. Technical Analysis

Had  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.

&amp;#x200B;

# VIII. Conclusion

If  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.

Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.

Having been unable to sleep last night, my mind turned to my portfolio and dollar cost averaging. (I know, lame right, no need to point that out.)

So, dollar cost averaging, a great idea to try and smooth out the purchase price for stocks that you consistently add to your portfolio. I thought I would apply this technique to building my portfolio, but I have found that during the last 12 months I have been adding different amounts to my various stock picks / ETF's, based on the current price, previous level of investment and available capital. The real world application of trying to apply DCA in my view.

So, I was thinking about what technique(s) could be used to ensure that the decision making process for where to invest my next available chunk of capital would be less driven by emotion / on the spot decision making, and more based on the facts of the current financial position of my portfolio. A basic score matrix is what came to mind. Scoring the individual holdings within the portfolio on the same pre-determined factors to suggest which position is the best to target for my next purchase.

My thinking makes the follow assumptions 

1) All positions within the portfolio are equally financially sound and I would happily invest more money in each of them.

2) I would be happy with all my holdings having the same level of investment, it excludes possible high risk picks that would not attract the same level of capital investment as more stable positions within my portfolio.

Example

|TICKER|Previous Capital Investment|Current % Profit / Loss|52Wk Hi/Lo Position|Score|RANK|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAA|4|1|4|9|7|
|BBB|3|2|3|8|6|
|CCC|5|3|6|14|2|
|DDD|1|5|7|13|4|
|EEE|6|7|2|15|1|
|FFF|2|6|5|13|4|
|GGG|7|4|1|12|5|

Previous Capital Investment - The stock with the lowest level of prior capital investment achieves the highest score, the stock with the highest level gets the lowest score.

Current % profit / Loss - The stock with the highest % loss achieves the highest score. The stock with the highest % gain achieves the lowest score. 

52 Wk Hi/Lo Position - Each stock is scored depending on its position on its 52 week High / Low scale, in comparison to the positions of the others stocks. The stock that holds the lowest position on its Hi / Lo scale gets the highest score, whilst the stock that holds the highest position on its Hi / Lo scale gets the lowest.

Score - The sum of the ranks of the three categories

Rank - The score column is ranked from 1st to last, where the highest score attracts 1st place, the lowest score the last place.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the example, the next stock I would invest in would be EEE. 

It holds the 2nd lowest level of investment within my portfolio, it is currently posting the biggest drop / smallest gain within my portfolio but is fairly high up the 52 week Hi/Lo scale compared to my other holdings.

I would really appreciate any positive or constructive feedback. Am I missing a critical category in scoring my holdings, or am I giving too much weight to an irrelevant factor?"|investing|An alternative approach to cost averaging - Feedback appreciated|1.0|0.6

I have been going with the flow and investing in stock tips from the Motley Fool and heavily following ARK invest. I have some positions that are up crazy amounts, but overall my portfolio is up 30% since June. Comparing it with the S&amp;P 500, I am dead even in performance.

I have been wanting to create an optimal portfolio that fits my demands. I have spent the last week taking a Portfolio Management course from MIT on MIT's OpenCourseware website. I have been learning about statistical modeling, risk parity, modern portfolio theory, and some other cool stuff.

While learning, I decided I want to try and beat ARKK's portfolio (\~117% returns last year). My thought process is that ARKK, being an ETF, has government restrictions on weights/allocations that they can hold in the portfolio. My argument is that as an individual investor, it may be possible to run risk-parity models to have an optimized weighted ARK portfolio.

In further research, I came across the 7Twelve allocation model.

""**7Twelve** is a multi-asset balanced portfolio developed by [**Craig L. Israelsen, Ph.D.**](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2F7twelveportfolio.com%2FAboutUs.html&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cabecker%40mail.citadel.edu%7Cd5e493e74a27438f7ad708d8d1970e23%7C960c1081d06341f8844b41d738db04a3%7C0%7C0%7C637489794425232832%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=BB5uEDVvxG9Rs%2FJy6M8kHVz6H8CC0mzUl%2BHdlXT%2BimI%3D&amp;reserved=0) in 2008. Unlike a traditional two-asset 60/40 balanced fund, the **7Twelve** balanced strategy utilizes multiple asset classes to enhance performance and reduce risk.

The ***7*** of **7Twelve** represents the suggested number of asset classes to include in your portfolio. The ***Twelve*** represents the **12** separate mutual funds or exchange traded products to fully represent the **7** asset classes in your **7Twelve** portfolio.""

The 51-year standard deviation of return for the multi-asset portfolio of 10.15% is roughly 40% smaller than the 16.89% standard deviation of the S&amp;P 500 Index (meaning it is 40% less volatile) – yet the 51-year 9.51% average annual return of the multi-asset portfolio is only 12% smaller than the 10.75% return of the S&amp;P 500 Index.

With this finding and my original idea, I came up with an asset allocation that I wish to try as opposed to solely making investment decisions off of recommendations from others.

I want to model a traditional 60/40 Stock/Bond portfolio. However, instead of Bonds, I want to 40% of my portfolio to follow this 7Twelve model.

The 7Twelve Model in my portfolio will be broken down as follows:

8.33% Large US : 10 Large Cap ETFs

8.33% Mid US : 10 Mid Cap ETFs

8.33% Small US : 10 Small Cap ETFs

8.33% Non-US : 10 International ETFs

8.33% Emerging Markets : 10 Emerging Market ETfs

8.33% Real Estate: 10 REITS

8.33% Natural Resources : 10 Natural Resource ETFs

8.33% Commodities : 10 Commodities ETFs

8.33% High Yield US Bonds: 10 HYB ETFs

8.33% Inflation Protected Bonds: 10 IP Bonds ETFs

8.33% Non-US Bonds: 10 Non-US Bonds ETFS

8.33% Cash

As for 60% stocks, I am considering 25% ARK/other tech ETFs , 25% individual tech stocks, and 10% Bitcoin (implementing a Kelly Strategy with Bitcoin here).

As far as respected returns, YTD data that I modeled shows I can expect my 40% 7Twelve allocation to return 4.5% minimum and 7.79% maximum. (Plan to rerun these calculations with 3 month, 1 year, and 3 year data sets soon).

My 60% expected returns of ETFs, Stocks, and Bitcoin will require more calculations.

I am making this post to ask if anyone has ever seen, or dare I ask tried, a strategy similar to this. For some background, I am a recent Computer Science graduate with minors in Cybersecurity, Statistics, and Mathematics. I currently work in IT, and very clearly see the vision set forth by many of the Tech companies I invest in. I am also 22 and very far ahead of my peers in terms of personal finance, so I am willing to take the risk on trying this allocation.

Would love to hear some thoughts/feedback!

**TLDR: I am convinced an argument can be made that ARK's portfolio can be beaten by an individual with an optimized portfolio using Risk-Parity (due to government regulations on ETFs). I will hold 25% allocation of ARK until I calculate out a testable solution.**

**I am convinced that the 7Twelve allocation can replace 40% bonds in a tradtional 60/40 Stock Bond split. The 7Twelve allocation should yield more returns than bonds (historically comparable to S&amp;P500), and offers far more diversification.**

**I want to design a portfolio that leverages these two arguments to try and beat ARK's performance with my 60% stocks/etfs and significantly reduce risk and maximize reward with my 40% 7Twelve allocations.**

1613367613.0|0.0|t3_lk6tki|14.0|"I've read a decent amount recently about spreading assets between tax advantaged and taxable accounts.

My question: Is it reasonable to factor in future tax  rates at withdrawal to weight assets in accounts when setting asset allocations?

For example: Say I have 100k in my 401k and 50K in my Roth IRA. I expect my total tax rate in retirement (federal and state) to be about 20%. Normally, if I were doing a 60/40 stock/bond split, I might do a 40 stock/60 bond split in the 401k, and a full 50k in stocks in the Roth. However, only 80% of the money in the 401k will actually be mine (because of future 20% tax rate), so to achieve a full 60/40 split I should instead do a 35/65 split in the 401k. Math below:
401k: 100k in assets * 80% actual withdrawal, real assets are 80k
Roth: 50k, with no taxes at withdrawal, so full 50k
80k + 50k = 130k real assets. 40%*130k = 52k in bonds. To hold in 401k, divide by 80% to get actual allocation of 65k bonds in 401k.

The above is intended to eliminate accidental real overweighting to asset categories that are held in accounts with lower tax withdrawal rates, and ensure the desired allocation is reflected in reality.

Please feel free to ask any clarification questions, as I'm sure I've laid this out in a pretty confusing way. I realize the impact may not be huge, but I'd like to understand if I'm completely wrong to be looking at things this way."|investing|Weighting asset allocations based on future withdrawal tax rates|14.0|0.74

* He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)
* As of early 2021 all 100 companies have posted a 100% return
   * (Share price at end of 2019 -  Share price End of January 2021) / (Share price at end of 2019)

I thought that statement was bonkers, so I took a list of NYSE + NASDAQ companies \~ 6500, excluded SPACs/warrants and anything that through an error in google sheets (lazy I know), which left around 5000 equities.

&amp;#x200B;

* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a &gt;100% return from their 52 week low
* Of the 5,000 equities, Over 500 have posted a &gt;500% return from their 52 week low

So 2,500, or \~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS &lt;0).

What blows my mind is of these 2,500 ""unprofitable companies"" :

# 1,795 have had a &gt;100% return from their 52 week low

# 500 of the  have had a &gt;50% return YTD

WTF?

* 50% of all publicly traded NASDAQ/NYSE companies are not profitable
   * Filter 1 = only list equities where TTM EPS &lt;0
   * Result = 2500
* Yet 35% have posted a 100% return from their 52 week low
   * Filter 1  = only list equities where TTM EPS &lt;0
   * Filter 2 = Filter 1 +  only list equities where ((current price - 52weeklow)/52weeklow) &gt; 100% )
   * Result = 1795
* And  10% have had a **2021 YEAR TO DATE RETURN OF &gt; 50%**
   * Filter 1  = only list equities where TTM EPS &lt;0

Among this rush of consumer spending we may have completely forgotten a very minor but substantial subcategory of goods, which is healthcare that is a luxury (what I mean here is health-related goods, which inherently tend to be high profit margin but also have the benefit of being largely unregulated and fully privatized). I’m referring specifically to the orthodontics industry, which has seen an unprecedented change in usage. The orthodontics industry has seen tremendous growth in general due to a change in living standards globally, where before a generally cosmetic issue such as the straightness of teeth has now become a social norm. This generally profitable industry has now become one of the largest adopters of 3D-printing and modeling technology, and as we’ve seen this is actually a normal industry trend; early or developing technologies are mostly implemented in high-margin, high-growth industries that have a significant margin of safety. The main company that’s in this hyper-specific industry I keep bringing up is Align Technologies ($ALGN), this company is the maker of Invisalign and the popular iTero oral scanner. Align dominates dental technology inside and outside of the doctor’s offices. Approximately 84% of Align’s business still comes from Invisalign however, and that’s probably a good thing as Invisalign is their flagship product that has years of research behind it which makes it inherently a high-margin good because each Invisalign update is just a minor successive improvement. Basically the logic for the revenues follows the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality, and because Align has tied in orthodontists into their ecosystem, they’ve virtually tied in customers for *multiple* business lifetimes. And despite these strong orthodontist contracts, Invisalign is actually primarily sold through a salesforce, directly to consumers. This is primarily due to the fact that their customer base extends beyond just people who see an orthodontist, which is a minority of the population in many places. However, Align has a potential market size that extends beyond just orthodontic patients, because on top of approximately 60% of the world needing help with alignment, there’s a large market share still in traditional orthodontic gear that could easily be won over: “Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth''. A lot of these orthodontic procedures are seen as luxury goods in the developing world, but as living standards and innovation expand, we can expect dental alignment to be as common a luxury as makeup or other cosmetic goods. Due to Align’s ***clear*** product superiority, we can expect a massive exodus from traditional braces towards invisible aligners, and this estimate of the possible market share capture would be pretty fair to assume. As of now, only about ⅓ of Align’s customers are from Asian markets, where a huge potential consumer population lies. The orthodontics industry as a whole as varying amounts of estimated CAGRs, from 8-13% depending on the source. For any given industry, above 10% CAGR is great. For Align, in the past quarter alone their revenues increased 28% and their revenue has increased by 22% from 2018 to 2019. A lot of this growth comes from simply having a better product than traditional braces, as consumers prefer having a lighter, easier to remove, and better looking product. In terms of their competitive advantage as a product, Invisalign is basically unmatched. There are new companies popping up in this segment but they’re too small to take advantage of as they’re not even public. The best public comparison that’s as hyper focused as ALGN is $XRAY, or Dentsply Sirona, but they lack any competitive advantage whatsoever in terms of providing direct-to-consumer goods. Dentsply is also not even profitable, while Align enjoys a *net profit* margin of 68% (this means after every good is sold, every employee is paid, and every interest payment is made, Align will keep 68% of the money they made on selling their Invisalign *and iTero* products). 

On top of this, we see revenue growth of over 25% year on year, which is outstanding for such a product. As more consumers strive towards wanting dental perfection as a norm, convenience and technology will be #1 on the list for them. Align provides this, and they have managed to consumerize and technologize orthodontics. This makes them the only eligible candidate within healthcare that has the growth prospect of any other consumer product such as Apple and the iPhone. The moat of having orthodontist connections and a 20 year old product line demonstrates that the growth seen here will be sustainable for generations to come. 

On top of this, Align has seen zero issues in liquidity with a significant increase in Free Cash Flow in the past 4 years. Align also has a spectacular 39% Return on Assets, and 57% return on equity. All of this spectacular profitability is accompanied by a (relatively) low valuation. Considering it’s a tech company with revenue growth matching that of many other growth stocks with inflated valuations, the fact that it’s profitable alone is a good reason to buy, but a P/E ratio of 27 also makes it quite tempting. The stock price has grown over 120% in the past year, which is an indicator that bullish sentiment is still overwhelmingly present. On top of this ALGN has seen very low volatility in terms of price movement as well, it has basically been a straight line of appreciation so those with a smaller appetite for risk would love to have this one in their portfolio.

Invisalign suggestion rates show us that the usage of Align’s flagship product has yet to reach its full potential. 

On top of this, Invisalign is aggressively expanding overseas: 

“We continue to expand our Invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors. In 2019, we trained 22,270 new Invisalign doctors of which 9,765 were trained in the Americas region and 12,505 in the International region.”  

And the cherry on top will be an administration change that will take the US out of a trade war with China: “On a year-over-year basis, our International Invisalign volume increased 34.0% driven primarily by increased adoption as well as expansion of our customer base in both the EMEA and APAC regions. *However, beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in China primarily due to the US-China trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases.”*

As COVID eventually goes away and so do tariffs, that already strong growth should see yet *another* boost. Here’s the final line: 

***We expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology, which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, since the teenage and younger market makes up 75% of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year, and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs, we expect our utilization rates to improve.***

Clear product advantage, sustainable growth, and a bargain industry with only overall growth in sight makes Align a worthy long-term investment."|investing|Align Technologies Due Diligence (ALGN)|2.0|0.53

I read in another post that [https://whalewisdomalpha.com](https://whalewisdomalpha.com/) is a good way to research 13F filings to understand what institutional investors are doing. I was wondering if anyone has other references to trend or weigh what institutional investors are doing?

Below are a few of the main lessons that I've learned after losing money investing in biofuel stock when I was fresh out of college (2012). 

· Discovered over time, more success with index funds that individual stocks. Concede that index funds outperform managed funds and Institutional investors have more resources to outperform retail investors. Always dollar cost average into and out of investments.

· Disclaimer that this is for long term (5+ years holding) investors and that have at least 80% of their investments in uncorrelated highly ranked index funds. 

7 Steps to Finding High Alpha Stocks:

1. Research consumer and social psychology trends. Millennial’s interest in health and wellness, travel, finding new online services to more efficiently do work and are conscious of company’s impact on the environment.

2. Research economic trends like spending habits and interest rates.  

3. Research top exclusive performing growth funds over time. Included a link in the description.

4. Identify similar holdings.

5. Learn about what the companies do and if that aligns with the consumer trends you identified in Step 1.

6. Identify which companies have the largest addressable market and competitive advantage (moat). (winner take all or winner take most)

7. Evaluate % Revenue Growth over last 3 years (demand), Price/Earnings, Value/EBITDA relative to other companies in the same sector.

**Optional:** Rebalance every quarter by taking approximately 20% from the winners and allocate to losers.

1613335244.0|0.0|t3_ljwv2c|21.0|"For those of you who aren’t familiar with this situation I will outline a brief summary here. On Dec 16th, it was announced APHA would acquire TLRY through a reverse merger, with the new company trading under the TLRY name. Through this merger, each share of APHA will be converted to 0.8381 shares of the new TLRY ticker. However, there is currently a price dislocation in the market, as APHA closed Friday at 16.94 compared to 29.00 for TLRY. This represents a 30% discount from fair value on APHA.

The obvious trade to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is to put on a long/short pair trade. I’ve seen a few posts outlining this idea already. Basically, it would entail going long 1 share of APHA and short 0.8381 shares of TLRY. Theoretically this would capture the entire 30% dislocation as both companies trend towards their fair conversion ratio. There are, however, a few flaws/risks with this trade that should be considered. 

1. Borrow rates. In order to short TLRY you will need to pay interest to borrow the stock. This interest rate is quoted daily, and has fluctuated between 8-22% this past week (annualized). Assuming the holding period for this trade is 4 months - based on the merger occurring in Q2 - you would be paying 2.5-7.5% in interest at today’s rates. Now this doesn’t sound like a big deal because we’re capturing a 30% return right? Sure, assuming rates and share price remain at these levels. Now let’s assume TLRY continues to squeeze up to 100, now you’ve tripled your short position and need to pay triple the interest. Furthermore, the borrow rate will likely increase with price, and we’ve seen extreme borrow rates before, sometimes even in excess of 100% (GameStop topped 150% for a short period last summer). Very quickly you can see that interest rates have the potential to eat away at your returns.

2. Margin requirements. Along the same lines as my first point, if TLRY squeezes back up to ATHs your broker is going to require significant margin to hold your position. Remember, even though this is theoretically a delta neutral play with the impending merger, your broker won’t recognize your long APHA position as a hedge against your TLRY short. There could come a point where the margin balance required to hold the trade won’t justify the max profit potential.

Okay - so how do we play this then?

I’m suggesting a play that involves going long APHA shares and hedges with ITM TLRY puts. Specifically, let’s look at the June 100p. It would look something like this using Friday close numbers:

Long 100/0.8381 = 119.32 shares of APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p on TLRY

Premium on the puts is 75.525. 

If, at expiry TLRY trades at or below below 100, then the profit will be:

APHA
(P-16.94)*119.32*0.8381

TLRY
(100-P)*100 - 75.525*100

= 426.26

Essentially what we’re doing here is paying a slight premium on the put to lock in the short interest rate on TLRY and remove margin risk (we are essentially locking in the margin required for the trade - eliminating the risk of getting margin called if TLRY squeezes). 

Now the beauty of this trade is that you are now also delta positive. Assuming price dislocation does not increase, you are poised to capture another spike in APHA’s share price, profiting disproportionately on your long shares (because the delta of your TLRY put will trend down). Therefore there could be an opportunity to close the trade early for a profit - but if not you are secured by the fundamentals of the merger conversion ratio at expiry.


I believe using this strategy is at least lower risk than the long/short pair trade. This being said, there is still risk - and that is if for some reason the merger does not go through. This is unlikely, but possible. If this is the case, it is my speculative opinion that APHA will still outperform TLRY. My evidence for this that APHA traded at a higher per share value than TLRY pre-merger announcement in December. Upon announcing the deal, APHA sold off - indicating that the street saw the merger as an over pay for APHA. This assumption could be distorted by the political events that have ensued since that merger (it could be argued that the blue senate disproportionately benefits the American based TLRY compared to the Canadian based APHA). However, it is still my biased opinion that APHA is the better company absence of the merger.

TLDR:

Long 119.32 shares APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p TLRY

Hopefully this post doesn’t get lost in the sub. I’ve scrolled through this sub for a few weeks now, As well as WSB. More of a lurker than anything, I read a lot of books and take most of my strategies from old white dudes who have had massive success, not to say anyone in here doesn’t know what they’re talking about, because I’ve found that not one way works. Guys like Buffet, Graham, Dalio, Lynch, Musk all have different types but all made money. 

This’ll be short, I’ve seen a lot of posts about hedging against rising volatility in today’s market and shorting certain companies, investing in bonds, and buying commodities such as gold/silver(one of my favorites).

I figured this info would be better served here than in WSB where everything apparently goes to the moon, but there is a Fund designed by Cambria called TAIL. In short, in invests in put option contracts both short and long inside the US stock market. The fund is designed to perform well in a market downturn and hedge against a collapse, so naturally right now it’s not performing well and it’s not supposed to. The majority of the assets of the fund are placed in intermediate US treasury bonds and the expense ratio is rather high at .59%. But this fund is always something I keep in the back of my mind if I see any signs that looks like the market could take a tumble. I’ll post the link here (idk if I’m allowed to or not) but if it gets deleted I’ll repost and you can find the fund on Cambrias website. 

I do not use this fund, I’m still in the stage of my life where seeking alpha is the priority and I have very little to hedge but I know family members who use it to consistently protect their assets every year and it’s a lot less work to manage.

I am not a financial advisor and this is not professional advice. I hope this finds some of you well and helps to protect some assets during this volatile markets and whatever comes next.

For example, below table is the outcome showing the transactions reported by institutional investors since the 11th of February on 4 different companies.


    total   buys  sells      total_shares_exchanged

    ATVI  115.0  104.0   11.0               1161650.0


While the data is useful, I am struggling to make a good use of it. For instance, if I look into MSFT, I can see that 127 institutional funds bough stocks in MSFT and 27 sold stocks. 

What I would like to do with this analysis is to find stocks that institutional investors are currently buying a lot. 

Does someone know what would be the best approach to do this? I thought about running the script for a bunch of companies and compare them together. But that approach does not make sense because obviously, large market-cap companies will attract more transactions than small-cap companies and they may not be really comparable.

My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

For my last r/investing post on GameStop I'll first take a step back to look at GME from a broader perspective before a brief discussion of the past week.

# The Biggest Picture?

A comment on one of my prior posts asked if I would ever post 'the biggest picture', so since this is my last post, I guess I had to [give it a try](https://u.teknik.io/h5uDf.PNG).  I know that some of you have ISPs that apparently block [teknik.io](https://teknik.io), so perhaps someone else would be kind enough to put it somewhere else and share a link in the comments.

The image is a mash-up of an intra-day chart (ex. pre-market and after-hours) spanning from January 8 through Friday Feb 12, along with some short interest data from FINRA and Ortex, as well as a chart of WSB membership (special thanks to [subreddidstats.com](https://subreddidstats.com) for the data behind that one).  The short interest data may actually be of active use for those of you still in the trade or considering jumping in, so I will note that the labeled points fall on the correct days for the data (not necessarily when the data were made available) according to the labeled timeline.

A few thoughts to go along with the image:

1. The now-(in)famous DFV began publicly posting about his due diligence and investments in GME back in August 2019.  I think we all wish we had seen it and/or grasped the significance sooner.  Takeaway: Reddit and other sites have these types of hidden gems scattered throughout the much higher volume of noise.  Learning to sift through the noise and identify good information quickly is an incredibly valuable skill to develop.  Note that popularity is not a great measure, as DFV was mercilessly mocked (at least mostly in good humor) for the vast majority of the time he was posting about GME, in spite of some of his work being of shockingly good quality.
2. Throughout 2020 there were many other high-quality signals that GME might be worth a closer look.  I've highlighted a few, but there were many more.  Even the unfortunately titled CNBC piece highlights the console supercycle and how that typically helps GameStop, and Jon Najarian called out the fact that there was some pretty remarkable action in Feb calls back in December (someone obviously knew not only what was going to happen, but almost exactly when it would happen... almost as if they knew because they were going to help make it happen?).  These things are easy to highlight in hindsight, and again I'm sure we all wish we'd paid more attention, but to be fair they were also by no means impossible to catch and interpret at the time.  I try to make it a habit to spend a bit of time after each trade trying to consider how I might handle this aspect of investing research better/more effectively in the future.  Note that while the squeeze ended up being the dominant play with respect to potential returns, most of the signals were high-quality fundamental value investing signals.
3. The likely potential returns on the squeeze play decayed exponentially relative to how widespread the hype got.  This is a point people often make anecdotally, so I tried to include some data to illustrate the point, using WSB subscriber numbers as a convenient and surprisingly effective proxy for the level of hype.  Once the hype train really got rolling, you can see the sharp inflection in WSB subscriber numbers, which occurred just about precisely on the day the squeeze went critical.  Max hype (the steepest rate of climb) was probably about exactly the point where Jim Cramer emphatically called for retail investors to take the win and sell the high (the timing of which, in retrospect, was almost uncanny).  Takeaway: people aren't just trying to be witty/a buzzkill when they say that you should sell when everyone is hyped.  At least in momentum trades or market dislocation trades (and GME was a combo), it is seriously treated by many seasoned and battle-scarred veterans as perhaps the most critical indicator of when to get out.
4. Other than qualitative and subjective indicators like hype, there were also very high quality data indicators, such as Ortex SI estimates, that, with the correct interpretation, would also have helped to make reasonably optimal decisions.  Note that in the case of Short Interest, the publicly available free data, which would have told you the same thing, was only available after it was far too late to be useful.  Premium data sources can easily justify their expense when used properly.  If I had not had access to the Ortex data, and left more of my position on for even 1 or 2 days longer as a result, the cost of that could easily have been equivalent to more than 100 years of the current Ortex subscription cost.  Note however that mere access to the data is not the same as being able to use it effectively--you have to have both to see the return in value.  S3/shortsight were apparently tweeting mostly the same data for free for marketing during the squeeze, and it did most people no good because they had no idea of how to interpret it (or whether they should trust it).  Takeaway: whether premium or free, accurate, timely data that you can trust and understand how to interpret is beyond critical in a fast-moving market environment.  Consider where you get the information on which you base your investments and trades, and where there is room for improving both the quality and timeliness of your sources, and also your ability to understand and act upon them.  Also seriously consider whether you are trading a large enough pool of capital to make it worth paying for access to premium information.
5. The humorously labeled 'Vlad's Valley' on the image is a reminder that no one, and I mean NO ONE can predict what will happen next.  I took some flack for writing this on almost every one of my posts, but I doubt any of us would have expected black swans to be nested inside each other like matryoshka dolls as we saw during the last few weeks of the GME trade.
6. Seriously, no one knows what happens next.  During the period I labeled as Peak ""I told you so"", the people who doubted that the squeeze thesis was ever valid to begin with felt vindicated and emboldened to publicly throw out pronouncements of how the price would immediately crash sub $10 and the company would go bankrupt... and while the price certainly did crash from the squeeze highs, it did so.. to &gt;200% its pre-squeeze hype levels, with serious support at $40, and running battles between $50 and $60.  And despite talking a big game on CNBC, the GME bears haven't yet put their money where their mouth is, as short interest has been declining (though that looks like it may have changed in the last couple of days--I'll discuss later).
7. The short interest in this stock is still very high.  That being said, the situation is much more volatile and dangerous, and less certain than it was pre-squeeze, for obvious reasons.
8. Fundamentals always matter in the end.  At this point, as I mentioned in my prior post, the situation with GME is in an unstable equilibrium between short covering (both profit-taking and capitulation) and longs selling (also either capitulation or greatly diminished profit-taking).  The best hope for a positive catalyst to the upside is good fundamental news, which will hopefully be coming in the form of an improved strategic vision for the company and continued growth and performance of their digital omnichannel, as well as good earnings results from the console supercycle.

# The Past Week in GME

The sharp, parabolic rallies and dropoffs that have been occurring over the past week look to me like a continuation of the dynamic I mentioned again above--primarily short covering vs longs selling, though the past two days have seen a very slight increase in short interest, which would have contributed to the resistance to upside price movement.

I believe this uptick in short interest to be a combination of new shorts entering at these levels, and also older shorts, still underwater, trying to keep price contained.  The sharper moves 2 weeks ago, upon further inspection, look like imbalances between the residual margin-called short position liquidations being tested by long whales' HFT algos on top of the possible covering by the shorts that entered near the squeeze highs as I mentioned in my last post.  Those sharp moves probably made older surviving shorts nervous, as the lower liquidity environment could easily allow the prices to spike high enough to put them back in the danger zone, so they will now be looking to aggressively cap any moves that look like they have any kind of potential to catalyze momentum back to the squeeze highs.  Previously those moves were so powerful that, to a GME bear, trying to cap them would have just increased potential losses to little effect, but the moves this past week probably looked like a more acceptable risk to take.

# So What's Next?

No one knows, of course, but I will state that I hope that next week, or at least some time in the near future, we will get to hear some good news about GameStop's new strategy.  Expectations are high, but you couldn't have paid for the kind of public attention set-up they now have to make some big, high-impact announcements.

Under the hype around the squeeze, the positive fundamental developments have continued, such as a slew of [promising executive hires](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer).  For those doubting the Chewy Team's commitment to active involvement with GME, these include Kelli Durkin as VP of Customer Care, previously Chewy's VP of Customer Service.  I'll note that a valid criticism of GameStop has been its treatment of customers.  Chewy has had one of the highest net promoter scores you can find in any large-scale retail operation, so hopefully she can bring some of that magic to GameStop.

With Reggie Fils-Aimé, the 3 Chewy board members, two Hestia members, and presumable RC ally Carrie Teffner (she came from PetSmart, which bought Chewy from RC), and the other members with strong applicable backgrounds on the proposed slate of board members to be elected at the next annual meeting, it looks like the current board and company are continuing to lean in to the need to pivot under new leadership.  The potential for a much brighter future is certainly there.

1613265175.0|0.0|t3_ljdyk2|68.0|"Hey guys. Today I'm sharing a DD on a favorite long hold stock pick, Broadwind Inc. (BWEN).

Broadwind Inc. Company Profile: 

Broadwind, Inc. provides products to the energy, mining, and infrastructure sector customers primarily in the United States. It operates through three segments: Heavy Fabrications, Gearing, and Industrial Solutions. The Heavy Fabrications segment provides fabrications to various industrial markets; and steel towers and adapters primarily to wind turbine manufacturers. The Gearing segment offers gearing, and gearboxes and systems for onshore and offshore oil and gas fracking and drilling, surface and underground mining, wind energy, steel, material handling, and other infrastructure markets. The Industrial Solutions segment provides supply chain solutions, inventory management, and kitting and assembly services to natural gas turbine market. The company sells its products through its direct sales force and independent sales agents. 


I like this stock and think it will do well for the following reasons: 

1) Good Fundamentals

Let's start by taking a look at the companies fundamentals. 

Market Cap: 166.33M

Enterprise Value: 203.7M

Revenue: 207.43M 

Quarterly Revenue Growth Rate: 18.4% 

Gross Profit: 15.4M

EBITDA: 9M

EPS: -0.07

Total cash: 4.5M

Total Debt: 42M

The first thing you should notice is that annual revenues are greater than both Market Cap and Enterprise Value. This means that the overall value of company based on its stock price is valued less than the revenue it generates in one year. 

In addition, you will note a quarterly revenue growth rate of 18.4%. This is a decent number, nothing crazy, but gradual and sustainable. If you examine their YoY revenue charts you'll see that this growth has been consistent for several quarters. 

The company is also turning over a gross profit of 15.4M. This can help cover some of the total debt which amounts to 42M. With their current revenue generation I don't expect any short term debt to be an issue that can cause insolvency. Also, over the last year, Broadwind produced more free cash flow than EBIT. 

Insiders hold 15% of the company, and institutions hold 45% - another positive sign. 

Over the past 4 quarters, the company has matched 2 analyst EPS consensus estimates, and beat 2. 

Est. EPS         -0.04   0.02   0.02   -0.06

Actual EPS.   -0.04   0.06   0.03   -0.06



2) Experienced Management Team

A company is only as good as the people who operate it, and thus having a solid management team is a key factor. 

The current CEO, Eric Blashford, is a 20 year industry veteran serving in various executive positions. He is an MBA and accounting graduate. 

The CFO, Jason Bonfigt, has been with the company for over 10 years and has an MBA from Kellog School of Business.

The VP of engineering, Dennis Janda, has been an engineer for over 42 years and graduated with a master's in mechanical engineering from University of Michigan. 

The chairman of the board, Stephanie Kushner, is a 25 year industry veteran with multiple executive positions in her career. She has an MBA in Finance from Wharton.

In addition to the exec, the company has over 200 employees across the country. They are actively hiring and have several open positions at time of writing. 



3) Hot Industry and Diversification 

The company focuses primarily on WIND energy, making this one of the few strong wind plays on the market. While solar has its benefits, wind is considered a superior energy source. It doesn't require sunlight, wind turbines produce less CO2 emissions, and more energy  - one wind turbine can generate the same amount of electricity per kWh as about 49,000 solar panels. 

With the Biden administration and Democrat Congress, in addition to Xi Jinpings declaration for China to pivot towards sustainable energy sources, I believe 2021 will be the year when the renewable market really takes off. Broadwind is well positioned to benefit from increased investments, research, and commercialisation in this industry. 

It should be noted that Broadwind derives approximately 30% of revenue from other industries beyond wind power. This includes an industrial gears segment, serving primarily the energy and mining industries and an industrial solutions segment, focused predominantly on gas turbines. This is a goal of management to improve diversification of the business so that they are not hostage to demand wind installations. In fact, Broadwinds acquistion of Red Wolf a company supporting gas turbine installations, shows management does wish to actively diversify through what they term their ""revenue diversification initiative"". 



4) Price Action and Forecasts 

The company has seen a 400% in its price since last year. While a major run, the company still remains undervalued. Currently, the price is undergoing consolidation and the 1 month and 5 day RSI are in the 45-50 range. Average volumes over the past 1 month have been greater than the overall average by a notable margin. 

The short % is small at about 3.26% of shares outstanding, and has not risen rapidly even with the huge price increase over the past year (a bullish sign).

Analyst consensus price target is $12.5 with a high of $13, well above its current trading price of 9.98. Consensus recommendation rating is 2.2 (Buy) 

Earnings are Forecast to grow 101% per year. 

According to Simply WallSt. analyses, the stock is trading at 77.9% BELOW it's fair value. 



5) Catalysts

A) A number of institutional investors have recently bought and sold shares of the business. Wells Fargo &amp; Company MN boosted its stake in Broadwind by 4,711.8% during the 4th quarter. Russell Investments Group Ltd. acquired a new position in Broadwind during the 4th quarter valued at about $1,263,000. THB Asset Management acquired a new position in Broadwind during the 4th quarter valued at about $1,695,000. Hussman Strategic Advisors Inc. acquired a new stake in shares of Broadwind in the 4th quarter worth approximately $525,000. Finally, Harel Insurance Investments &amp; Financial Services Ltd. acquired a new stake in shares of Broadwind in the 4th quarter worth approximately $128,000.

B) Tax credits for wind projects in the U.S. were extended in 2020.

""In December 2019, the United States production tax credit for renewable wind projects was extended for one-year, pursuant to a year-end 2019 appropriations bill, from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021. As a result of the new legislation, the PTC will subsidize wind projects commenced as late as 2020 and completed by 2024, or later, if continuous construction can be demonstrated""

This had led to the company being ""nearly booked"" at full capacity for 2020 for wind tower sections which it reports as part of its ""heavy fabrications"" segment. The company is also at 35% of capacity for 2021, both data points from the November earnings call. Again, as noted above, even though the tax credit ends in a few weeks, per current legislation, projects have until 2024 to complete.



6) Comparables

NextEra Energy Partners Forward 1yr PE ratio: 33

Atlantica Sustainable Infrastructure Forward 1yr PE Ratio: 25.54

Broadwind Inc. Forward 1 yr PE Ratio: 16.3 

Compared to its peers, BWEN could trade at more of a premium to its current valuation. 



----&gt; Potential Issues/Problems:

Broadwind does have substantial net operating losses (NOLs) of around $14M

Neither Broadwind's ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT nor its level of total liabilities give confidence in its ability to take on more debt. 

Wind tower production is almost maxed out, this may cap earnings growth in 2021 without further expansion. 




---- Summary ----

Broadwind is a well established clean tech and industrial manufacturing company with a diversfied presence in both renewables and natural gas/oil verticals. It has a solid management team backed by years of experience and prestigious educational qualifications. 

Based on an initial assessment of its fundamental metrics, the company appears undervalued with a potential 78% upside. The companies balance sheet remains strong and incoming revenues are significant  with consistent quarterly increases, which should help manage its notable debt.  Market sentiment is somewhat positive at this moment based on analyst price and recommendation consensus. 

Broadwind operates in what is likely to be a high growth industry, especially with the prospect of offshore wind in the coming years, and further favorable legislation behind wind and infrastructure projects. 

Broadwind appears inexpensive relative to the broader market and trades at a discount to other renewable companies. This could offer substantial futher upside if it matches potential peers. 

However, production is currently maxed out and pricing power is not apparent. As such, the next leg of price appreciation would be more reliant on re-rating of the valuation and further expansion, which does seem likely in the current market environment and enthusiasm for renewable energy firms.

I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

""**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. “After all,” I said, “this company has the potential to grow since it’s in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.” Don’t you know,” my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, “that that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.”** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**""It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings.""** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase ""**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots""** is also bringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**""For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works.""** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie ""**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat."".** this is almost an exact repeat of the dot com bubble, I never thought it was this similar but wow, I think I will begin to hedge my portfolio and I would caution against saying this times is different.

It recommends a diverse set of investments that should last several months (for potential long term capital gains.)

I have backtested this many decades back and it works better than investing 100% into VTI. That was my simple goal.

It takes a long time to run through the history of hundreds of funds.. I've spend several months worth of time to speed it up using various tricks, but still it takes a good 30 or so minutes to give a day's recommendation. To speed things up, instead of looking at individual stocks, I have it look through various sector and subsector/industry ETFs.

Here is the simplified version of sectors/subsector recommendations it has provided for the past year:

## January, 2020

1. High Yield Junk Bonds / Gov Bonds
2. Mortgage Real Estate / Broker Dealers / Technology / Aerospace &amp; Defense / Utilities
3. Semiconductors

## Mid-March, 2020

*Stock market recovery*

1. Software
2. Medical Devices / Semiconductors

## May, 2020

1. Technology (High percentage)
2. Software

## Mid-September, 2020

1. Technology (Significantly lower percent than in the previous months.)
2. Software
3. Clean Energy

## End of October, 2020

*Coronavirus vaccines pass phase III testing*

*Biden winning election*

1. Clean Energy
2. Software
3. Medical Devices

This last recommendation hasn't changed since October.

The recommendations look kind of obvious in retrospect.. ""Of course it was good to invest in technology right after the crash!"".. but it wasn't obvious when the crash first happened, nor was it obvious if the crash ""ended"" yet.. That's what I like.. in times of uncertainty, I can look up to this algorithm to show me what are the next steps.

Note the combination of funds are meant to compliment each other. Buying just the number one listed fund wouldn't be as effective.

What I love about these recommendations, other than the potential long term gains, is that I think the results can be shared with everyone, and it won't stop working.

It makes me wonder if I can set up some kind of subscriber system where anyone who wants to see the results of my algorithm can sign up and get emailed or something when there is a recommended change...

The algorithm should provide better results than VTI in the long term, but you may suffer losses in the short term.

But.. I am afraid if I start giving out the detailed recommendations, then someone will leverage their life savings based on my recommendations, lose a bunch of money in a week, then sue me for their losses..

Anyway, I am not sure if something like this is already available as an etf or something.. The recommendations seem to be based on momentum, only looking at historical prices, not fundamentals. Yet, the recommendations change when some major event / news happens."|investing|Long term industry recommendation algorithm results from past year|37.0|0.84

General Motors is sounding the alarm over an ongoing semi-conductor chip shortage that may force it to limit its production output in the future.
Today’s vehicles use an abundance of semiconductor chips for their various electronic systems, including powertrain control systems, advanced safety systems and in-car entertainment, among more. Automakers must compete with companies in the consumer electronics sector for the limited global supply of semiconductors, however, which may cut into their ability to maintain regular production output of certain vehicles.

According to The Detroit Bureau, GM, Renault, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and other major automakers have recently expressed concern over the worsening semi-conductor shortage. Additionally, Bosch, the world’s largest automotive supplier and a major manufacturer of electronic automotive components, has acknowledged that has been receiving “significantly fewer” chips than expected in recent months.
Other major suppliers, like Valeo and Continental, have expressed similar concerns as well, The Detroit Bureau reports.

When I saw that growth estimate I immediately thought they were sand bagging. All of their segments except the web division saw double digit growth in 2020. The first question on the latest analyst call asked why they were forecasting low growth and their CFO said it was due to expectations that their customers in the travel and hospitality division were asking for extended payment terms. I get the concern but that still doesn’t indicate there are any types of default/missed payments looming on the horizon. That sector will make a comeback.

Akamai continues to see a ton of growth in their cybersecurity segment which exceeded $1 billion in revenue for 2020, or 25% YoY growth. Media and carrier division was up 15% YoY. That makes up more than 60% of their revenue. 

I understand Fastly and Cloudfare are taking market share and growing at ridiculous 40-50% comps but to me both are getting a little bit overvalued and that was evident following NET’s drop after earnings. Same will likely happen to Fastly next week when they report.

Overall, this looks like a solid value play with Akamai currently trading at 11x EV/EBITDA for the next 12 months. Historically it trades closer to 15x which would put it around $120/share.

Made a quick analysis between the companies factoring in growth and EV for 2021. The lower EV/Sales to growth, the better.

AKAM: 0.76
NET: 1.10

**With that being said, if you had invested in Microsoft at the top of the dot com bubble you would not have seen a return on your investment until 2016.**

I believe we are now in the midst of a similar timeline. Some valuations are through the roof without any grounding in reality. It is hard to know when it will correct but I am convinced that at some point investors will once again begin valuing companies as the value of their future free cash flows + a risk premium.

For this reason I am adapting my personal investment strategy from 100% long to **110% long and -10% short** with some select picks.

I will be diversifying my shorts and limiting their initial notional value, wary of irrationality continuing. I expect this to be an investment strategy I can stick to for at least 1 year.

**I'd love to hear any contrarian views to my thesis and any thoughts on my short picks or suggestions.**

---

My picks (each will be -1% of my portfolio):

**1. TSLA** Not much needed to be said. Great company, love their products and direction. $800bn valuation is ludicrous.

**2. SHOP** $180bn valuation for $2.5bn revenue in 2020. 70% growth rate is great but where is my risk premium for my investment today?

**3. UBER** $113bn valuation with a -$22bn accumulated deficit. Gave up on self driving (their roadmap to profitability?) back in December. Propped up by SoftBank.

**4. ZM** $126bn valuation with $2bn TTM revenue and $400m net income. Guys, this is a company who offer video communication software. 0 MOAT or risk premium.

**5. SNOW** $85bn market cap, $489m TTM revenue and -$400m net income. For a data cloud service (hello have you heard of AWS/Azure/etc.?)

**6. DASH** $65bn market cap, $2bn revenue, -$200m net income. Financials aren't the most atrocious on this list but food delivery services (like ride sharing) are too location specific. No roadmap to global domination here.

**7. LMND** $10bn market cap for a ""tech"" insurance company with less than $100m revenue, -$100m net income. Their S-1 is filled with talk about their AI. Their ""chatbot AI"" on their website is a web form with a photo of a woman. Seriously?

Picks I am less bearish on but still considering going short.

**8. ABNB** $128bn market cap, $5bn revenue pre-covid. This one is hard for me. I like this company and think they have potential as a global business. Also a great pick post-covid. But I think $128bn is still too insane. Could be convinced otherwise.

**9. NIO** $94bn for the Chinese Tesla. Close to bankruptcy pre-2020 EV hype. Now has some momentum but $94bn worth? China growth can be scary though...

**10. SPCE** $13bn valuation. Richard Branson's pet project run rampant with a Chamath SPAC. Space, very cool. Return on investment is where sorry?"|investing|Some valuations are absurd - I am going 10% short|154.0|0.84

This is not investment advice.  Just me, in between watching South Park reruns, offering an overview of a company you may wish to check out.  Do your own due diligence.  Do your own homework boys and girls.   

Full disclosure:   I own a bunch of shares. 

TFFP (Thin Film Pharmaceuticals) has a special proprietary process for making just about any substance into tiny dry powder particles.    Many drugs are not solvent, have low  bioavailability, and the thin film matrix powder is much more readily absorbed by the human body.  Or, so the scientists say in peer reviewed published journals.   Lots of lab and some clinical studies published.   Data looks great.   

Why is this important?   
1).  There are many drugs that have awful side effects, adverse effects, that could be delivered much more safely with TFF delivery.  A smaller dose delivered directly to the lungs offers potentially way less adverse effects.  No stomach, kidney, liver absorption, for example.   
2).  There are many drugs that are super powerful in the lab but not so effective in the human body due to low absorption. Niclosamide is one example.  Powerful anti-viral but not easily absorbed.   TFF delivery could make this drug way more useful.  It’s an approved off patent drug so wide open to explore TFF delivery, eh.  Opportunity?   I think so.   
  Other drugs they are exploring include Tacrolimus and Voriconazole.   Either of these can seemingly be very well enhanced by TFF delivery.   The company has clinical trials underway and hopes doe approval doe both of those by early 2024.  Seems far away ?  Biotech stocks usually rise in anticipation and as clinical trials progress.  Usually.  Who knows.   It’s a stock.  Anything can happen.  
3).  In addition to their internal drug development they have many big pharmaceutical companies evaluating TFF delivery to enhance existing or future products.    Exciting.   License dollars abs royalties could be big big, if successful.  Who knows.  I’m hopeful. 
4).  They have one cannabis customer / partner announced but not yet launched. Theoretically TFF delivery for cannabis will be much safer than vaping.  Abs maybe better than edibles or smoking.   Even a small market share in this huge market would be game changing for tiny TFFP.   
4). They have research work underway with the US Army to innovate in the field dry powder therapeutics to protect troops.  Very prestigious group called USAMRIID game them the research contract    
5).  They are working with a university consortium to explore TFF delivery for a universal influenza vaccine.   Exciting.  
6).   The TFF dry powder is very stable.  No cold chain logistics.  This is a key cost saving abs headache saving for nearly any vaccine.  But recent the covid vaccine Cole chain logistics problems have been in the news.  Opportunity???  Time will tell.  

Do your own work.  The company has presentations on their website abs many news releases.   Do your own due diligence.     

Long and strong

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is my first idea I'm publishing to TradingView, so I'm eager to hear your thoughts/criticism.  
&gt;  
&gt;The  premise starts by stating that RIOT is highly correlated to  BTC  /USD,  given how the business model is  BTC   mining that seems fair. As such,  with the recent increase in  BTC  /USC RIOT has gained also, but  sometime on Feb  9th   it started diverging from  BTC  /USD and has only  increased the divide since then. Why? There hasn't  been a single  catalyst coming from inside the company and it doesn't  hold any  BTC    and is a money losing operation while trading at 1288 times last  quarter's  earnings . So my guess is that there's no reason to sustain  this diverges and thus we'll go down from here.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm not going to say it's going bankrupt, but it should revert back to being tightly correlated with  BTC  /USD.

Note:  Other comments suggest that the current boom is due to a press release  stating RIOT has begun using a newly acquired haul of bit mining  hardware.

Source: [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3661232-riot-blockchain-stock-climbs-as-new-miners-to-boost-capacity-to-1-ehs](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3661232-riot-blockchain-stock-climbs-as-new-miners-to-boost-capacity-to-1-ehs)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My prediction/guess - it reverts back to $33/share level.I've  dug deeper into RIOT since I saw some comments about their  historical  price. The company goes back to the year 2000, which seemed  odd for a  blockchain company. **After  reading their 2016 10-K report I  learned that up to later 2017 it was a  failing biotech company called  Bioptix (also having gone by the names  Venaxis and Aspen Biopharma).  They were going out of business but then  in 2017 the CEO rebranded it to  RIOT and started mining bitcoin.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**There  was even an SEC investigation (dropped in February 2020) into the   company. The investigation was due to possible securities fraud given  how they pumped their stock by adding ""blockchain"" to their name.**

But where does this money come from? Is it magic?

The fundamental reason is that there is more going into the pot than there is being taken out.

So surely the factors at play are population increase and the popularity of investing?

For example:

you have a small population of just 1,000 people who are the same age, they invest $10 each

If the population doesn't increase they can only take out what they put in when they sell to the next generation of 1000 people. Of course early sellers will be able to make more but that will leave the rest out of pocket, my point is, money isn't made magically. 

Imagine the population increases to 1billion who all invest and dont withdraw, those 1,000 people could then sell their stocks for a huge profit and live happily ever after, isn't that the current model? 

The population increase and popularity of investing has always been high but in recent times the US has had its slowest population growth in over 100 years.

It's also possible in the future that there will be alternative ways to invest money and the stock markets could crash.

Am I wrong?

Are we really guaranteed returns on our S&amp;P 500 tracker funds over the next 50 years?

Are there any existing studies and what other factors are at play?

UiPath, a software company that imo is a hidden gem, has it's IPO soon and I want to see what is the overall opinion about them.

I'm not a financial expert but I'm a software developer and I'll try to explain a bit their product and why I think it brings a lot of value into the software world.

UiPath's product is an RPA(Robot Process Automation) UI platform, easy to use, aiming to send repetitive computer tasks into history. I strongly suggest you to have a look at their product demo video on YouTube. 

""Process automation? Nothing new, we have it in the industry for ages"", very much true BUT... UiPath takes this concept and makes it available to people that are not necessarily software developers. There are a lot of automation tools, frameworks and libraries out there but they are meant to be used by people with software development background. Adding a high amount of usability to an existing concept is something that defines the success of some big tech players we currently have in the market.

""Are there so many out there that actually need this?"", a big YES. Think about how many age old processes are out there,  any job that is related to data operation is a possible subject for RPA. In fact, I'm absolutely sure that any of you at some point in life had to deal with a super boring repetitive task, like copy-paste from a website into a spreadsheet. Now imagine how many companies atm have operators that do exactly this kind of jobs and how appealing would be for these companies to say goodbye to the human operator and welcome a ""robot"" instead. Let's leave aside the moral part of the story for now.

As a company, I know that these guys take good care of their employees, this is a very strong point in the software industry. Most of their current customers are banks. Talking about old processes and outdated software solutions and I think banks are one of the ""leaders"", Win XP based ATMs say hello.

My biggest concern about their IPO is that it will be very ""priced in"" judged by the amount of investments they got recently and if you get in too soon you may end up holding the bag for a while but I honestly believe that long term it is very likely to be a good investment.

So what do you think about them and most importantly, do you see it as a good investment? What are, in your opinion, their strong points and weaknesses?"|investing|UiPath goes public soon, let's talk|36.0|0.85

That's an \~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.

I now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this?  When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers.  For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well.   The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.  

Now, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit.  When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of  payment for your transaction.  The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal? 

Basically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above,  Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments.  To quote,  PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there.  PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading. 

Basically, it’s doing it all.  PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues.  It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.

* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

The answer: Tesla.

Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*, not just their own cars, and has also more or less come out and said that he’s open to letting other auto manufacturers access their Supercharger network. That puts them squarely in the energy business as the single most capable distributor.

There’s also been chatter about licensing their self-driving technology, and using their self-driving technology as a recurring revenue generation, which would be a very attractive value-add for the other OEM’s. And all of these things don’t even begin to cover the expected growth in residential energy with products like rooftop solar, Powerwall, etc.""

I made a post like this about 2 years ago. And I'm doing it again because I think it's time to bring out my ""Repent for the end is nigh"" cardboard sign.

At the link above is a graph of the federal reserves balance sheet. As you can see, and as most of the finance folk of this sub know, we started the quantitative easing program after 2008 to get us out of the recession. It worked pretty damn well.

So well in fact that the Fed never stopped doing it. They now have exercised unprecedented control over the market. This comes with the inevitable exponential growth of their balance sheets. 

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming we continue this trend I have a few questions for your perusal.

1: Can the Fed QE to infinity?

2: We saw that when they started to reduce QE even just a tiny bit the market corrected. While this could have been coincidence can we say with any chance that if they tried again it would do the same?

2.5: Is it safe to say that the growth of most of the companies traded on the market is directly tied to QE? If so wouldn't this count as trillions worth of corporate stimulus? 


3: Rationally assuming QE is not infinite, and recognizing the strain covid is putting on all assets underlying the market, what will be your status in our new post apocalyptic world?

4: If QE is infinite then we are truly in an infinite growth utopia.

**TL;DR**: Risks to real estate from increasing natural disaster frequency are not not priced in. Mechanics behind how risk is spread out could mean rapidly spreading economic harm.

Some of you may remember 2008, the tumult of the housing bubble, and subsequent collapse in prices. Today housing prices are again at an all time high, outpacing inflation in a similar fashion to 2008. This has many folks who have money in real estate on edge. However, there are significant differences between today's market and that of 2008 in that the [demand appears to be real and the supply constrains appear to be real](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/NationalSummary_3Q20.pdf). But I am always on the lookout for weakness in this space since the housing market accounted for [15% of GDP in 2018](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF11327.pdf) (and is probably more in 2021). Weakness here tends to spread through the economy and affects all investments in one way or another.

Therefore, I present to you a very interesting threat to the housing market: **climate change**. In the following Harvard Business Review interview with John Macomber (a senior lecture in Harvard Business School) he lays out this threat as manifesting itself through the insurance sector.

[https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis](https://hbr.org/2020/12/are-we-on-the-verge-of-another-financial-crisis)

**For those who don't want to read the whole thing, I'll summarize as best I can**: Climate change is rapidly increasing the rate of natural disasters from hurricanes to flooding to wild fires. Insurance premiums are yet to express this primarily due to government intervention (IE states providing disaster relief and mandates to insurers). The risks to real estate as an investment are increasing rapidly, yet society appears unaware and the market is not pricing this risk in. When state governments and the federal government realize they can no longer to afford to subsidize the rebuilding/repairs to homes there is risk of the system snapping as insurers go bottom up and premiums shoot through the roof.

What's more insurers are actually insured themselves by ""re-insurers"" (bet you never heard of them before right) who then slice off some of the risk by providing insurance-linked securities called ""catastrophe bonds."" These are bought by investors who essentially get paid to take on some of the underlying risk. So the risk is spread out multiple steps away from the actual asset: your home. Sound familiar? This is eerily similar to the way mortgages were packaged and sold in the years leading up to 2008 (mortgage-backed securities). It is difficult to say how spread out and linked with the rest of the economy these catastrophe bonds are.

The fear is that housing prices are getting overinflated because the physical risk to the property are hidden from public view. Govt funds dry up. Insurers suddenly feel the full brunt of the increasing frequency of natural disasters. Premiums go sky high. Catastrophe bonds become worthless. Perceived wealth suddenly dries up and the contagion spreads through the whole economy. *Pop.*

There is more to the interview and if your interest is piqued I'll let you read the rest, but this is the point I want to discuss with you all.

**My Take:**

I was reminded about this hypothesis after Reuters did this article today about huge insurance rate hikes in Florida: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-insurance-florida/florida-consumers-flabbergasted-as-property-insurers-push-for-double-digit-rate-hikes-idUSKBN2AC111)

Now, I'm no expert in real estate or insurance, I'm just a guy who owns some property. But like any investor I want to make sure my investment is worth the value its assigned and that potential risks are mitigated. What concerns me about this scenario is how the very real risks caused by climate change to real estate are *not being talked about in the public sphere*. What else would climate change and the subsequent increase in natural disasters have a direct impact on except for real estate.

It is really hard to say if this situation could actually lead to a massive collapse of the housing market and subsequent economic recession. As John Macomber states the ideal situation is that these risks become more apparent over time and the risks get priced in. If so, it would provide mainly a downward pressure on the real estate market rather than trigger a collapse. I actually think this is the more likely situation when the market is taken as a whole. Surely certain pockets will experience higher risk than others.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

Let's talk about futures contracts for *imperishable goods*, lets just use ""widgets"" as an example, and let's assume there is *no margin or loan or leverage or fractional escrow involved.*

**Here is my (maybe wrong) understanding of how a futures contract works:**

When you purchase a futures contract you agree to buy or sell widgets at a certain price at a later date. Without any margin (borrowing) involved, the company that set up the contract (the broker) holds/locks the full amount of both the widgets and USD in escrow until the agreed-upon date, and then just swaps the two accounts on that date. Basically they hold the money in one hand, and widgets in another hand, then swap hands at the end of the contract.

**What I don't understand at all:**

The futures contracts sell at almost the exact same price as the current value of widgets. Why not just purchase widgets? If I buy a contract today for 1 widget at $1 on June 30, and on June 30 the price is $2, I made $1. But if I outright bought 1 widget today at $1 and sell on June 30 for $2 I would make the same amount. Why would I want to tie up my money in an escrow account for months and risk the escrow company going under during that time if I could just buy the underlying asset? I'm so confused. 

**Maybe the price of the futures doesn't always exactly track the current price of the underlying asset?**

I've developed decent skills identifying sectors that are in favor, buying and holding low cost index funds and sector ETF's focused on technology and innovation.

Long-term charts of market performance show there are periods of decline. Sometimes weeks to months (Covid in February - March of 2020) and sometimes a number of years (August 2000 - March 2003). My portfolio was reduced quite a bit between 2000 and 2003. I held on, rode it down, and back up.

Just like earthquakes, fires, and floods, it's good to think through a plan before the event comes. What's your plan to make it through a bear market?

Some presumably wise investors like having some cash on the side to pickup bargains during downturns. Some did that during the Covid drop. There are others that would either short the overall market on the way down, or buy inverse ETF's (ProShares for example. *Side note*: holding leveraged inverse funds for a long period of time, even a few days, can lead to unpredictable results due to decay.)

I got into $ITRM for about $500 a few days back without really knowing anything about it, a foolish move by a green investor. Only foolish because I bought it without knowing anything about the stock and just saw some conversation about it on stocktwits.

Well, since then it has gone down, so I decided to learn about what it actually is and if I should be patient or cut my losses. I have learned some about FDA approval processes, offerings, urinary tract infections, and that drug companies can exist for some time hemorrhaging money without ever having released a drug before! I found this all to be very interesting! I'd like to share the basics of what I learned, and also get opinions on this stock....

The company as mentioned, is a ""clinical-stage pharmaceutical company"", which I take to basically mean they have no approved drugs yet. My friend called it a gofundme for drugs when I explained it to him lol. They have been working on one drug, oral antibiotics for treating UTIs, which currently does not exist.

They have complete phase 3 (of which there are 4 phases) trials with good results and have applied with the FDA for approval(NDA). Approval for this drug is on FDAs ""priority list"", meaning if approved it is somewhat fast-tracked through the approval process. Expected approval is July of this year.

From my research I gather that the majority of drugs that pass phase 3 and apply for NDA are eventually approved. Something like over 80%. The company has also recently made a public offering of almost 2 million shares to raise capital that will cover operating expenses until 2023 (that happened a few days ago). They also recently created an agreement with a firm that specializes in assisting drug companies in the final phases of development to bring the drug to market(also very recent activity).

The stock price has really only gone down since the IPO and is currently at almost an all time low.

To me, it seems like the approval of this drug is imminent. Why would they be partnering with a company to hash out the logistics of the release if this weren't the case? Why would they still be raising capital if this were not the case? I have a strong sense that the drug will be approved.

Are there any experienced pharma investors here that can chime in on this or give their thoughts?

Does it follow that if the drug is approved the price will go up as I predict? Or is the price built in?

I think there is still quite some dd to do on this such as what would the drug cost and how many people need it, what is the competition, etc. Starting to look into these things but it gets pretty complicated.

Still a lot to learn but I feel good about this investment after my initial blindfolded dart throw.

Lockup expiration is also 2/18*** (didn’t realize palantir was reporting before market open). Warning: long post ahead and TLDR at the bottom.

**Palantir Business Overview**

* In one sentence, Palantir creates **operating systems** that integrates vast amounts of data from an organization’s various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making
* If that's confusing, no worries. The way I like to think of Palantir's software is that if Batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions, that software would be from Palantir
* The company has three main software platforms: **Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo**
* **Gotham (government side)**
   * Gotham is Palantir’s software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors, AKA governments
   * Gotham is an end-to-end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations
   * Gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many US federal agencies and rumor has it that it was the software that helped track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011
* **Foundry (commercial side)**
   * Next up is Foundry, a platform that is geared towards the 6,000 businesses around the world with over $500 million in revenue
   * Similar to Gotham, Foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data
   * For example, one of Palantir’s customers is Skywise, an aviation platform that has become the central operating system for the airline industry
* **Apollo (underlying infrastructure)**
   * Apollo is the last piece of the Palantir puzzle, and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that Gotham and Foundry lie upon
   * Apollo is a relatively new platform that Palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs Gotham and Foundry, increasing the number of upgrades Palantir can manage across installations from an average of 20,000 per week in Q2 2019 to more than 41,000 per week in Q2 2020
* The company has estimated its **total addressable market as $119 billion,** of which $63 billion is for the government side while $56 billion is for commercial side

**The Palantir Business Model**

* Known as **Forward Deployed Engineers or FDEs,** Palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for Gotham or company for Foundry
   * I believe that this in particular is what helped Palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector
* While the FDEs are a differentiator, Palantir has also started to build out a **more traditional salesforce** in order to better target customers and explain the company’s value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for 3% of the company’s total headcount
* Using both FDEs and a traditional salesforce, Palantir’s business model employs a 3 step process: acquire, expand, and scale
* **Acquire**
   * In the acquire step, Palantir provides a potential customer with a short-term pilot program at Palantir’s expense and therefore operate at a loss
* **Expand**
   * In the expand phase, Palantir seeks to understand the customer’s key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results
* **Scale**
   * The scale phase is where Palantir thrives. At this point, the customer is essentially using Palantir’s software for its operations and Palantir can also upsell to the customer by continually offering new services with minimal extra cost
* To give you a sense of the numbers for each phase, In 2019, Palantir generated a total of $742.6 million in revenue, of which **$0.6 million** came from customers in the **Acquire** phase, **$176.3 million** from the **Expand** phase, and **$565.7** million from the **Scale** phase

**The Bull Case**

* **Section 2377**
   * In 2016, Palantir sued the US Army in what’s known as Decision 2377
   * To go into the history a little bit, in 1994, the Federal Streamlining Acquisition Act (FASA) was passed, which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available, proven commercial services like Palantir’s rather than custom-developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently
   * This rule was largely ignored until Palantir sued and won in court, and this was extremely important because it allowed Palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies, which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market. Since then, Palantir's revenue from the US Army and US government has skyrocketed
* **Sticky, Best-in-Class Product**
   * Simply put, there is nothing that offers what Palantir is offering. Its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system
   * Palantir’s Gotham and Foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more it’s used, the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system
   * Palantir’s platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time, with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from 6 to 18 months
   * To further prove this point, Palantir’s top 20 customers have been with the company for an average of 7 years and as of October 2020, 93% of revenue was generated by existing customers
   * In addition to this, in the latest quarterly earnings, Palantir was selected out of 999 bids by the US Army for a 2-year $91 million contract to build AI and machine learning capabilities
* **Positive Secular Trends and Growing, Achievable TAM**
   * I think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and Palantir has spent $1.5 billion in the past 11 years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day
   * The company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected to grow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next 5 years
   * And with just about $1 billion dollars in revenue over the past 12 months, Palantir has less than 1% market share and has plenty of room for growth
   * But perhaps most importantly, Palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its TAM
      * In the latest earnings call, management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success
      * And among other improvements, the Apollo platform has helped the company greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running
   * Being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best-in-class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for Palantir

**The Bear Case**

* **Double-Edged Business Model**
   * While Palantir’s differentiated services and business model is one of the company’s key strengths, there are also several downsides as well
   * First, due to the custom-built solutions Palantir offers, the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum 6 month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing
   * Second, even if a customer jumps on board, contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of 3-6 months
   * Third, the deep history it has with customers results in a very top-heavy concentration
      * As of the third quarter of 2020, the top 20 customers represented 61% of the company’s revenue, which notably is down from 73% from the year prior
   * Lastly, the deal-by-deal nature of Palantir’s business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict, which can be a cause of concern for investors
* **Biden Administration and Negative Headline Risk**
   * First, Peter Thiel was an outspoken supporter of Trump, who increased defense spending 5% a year while Obama decreased spending 3% a year.
      * While I don’t think this will be a long-term issue, a Biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder Palantir’s growth with Gotham
      * However, it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue, stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesn’t foresee this to be a problem
   * Second, Palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present Palantir with headaches in the future
      * This risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that Palantir is 49.9999% owned by its co-founders, who are outspoken and strongly opinionated. Clear corporate governance risk.
* **Tough Competition in Commercial Space**
   * In my opinion the largest obstacle Palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space
   * Palantir offers an expensive, premium, custom-built end-to-end solution for clients, which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for
   * Instead, most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best-in-class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies
   * Several notable businesses left Palantir from 2019 to 2020, including JP Morgan, Coca Cola, and American Express, and this decreased the customer count from 133 to 125
   * However, one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call, Palantir’s management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular, which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire Foundry system
      * This also allows the company to offer different price points which may allow Palantir to be more competitive in the market
      * Recent news of bringing on BP and IBM as clients could also be a sign that its Foundry business may be ready for mass adoption
* **Lock-up Expiration**
   * Because this is a short-term risk, I’m adding this as a bonus bearish reason
   * Palantir went public through a direct listing on September 30, 2020, during which up to 20% of shares were available to trade (edit, thx for pointing this out!) for employees and stakeholders, (NOT all available shares outstanding)
   * This remaining 80% (roughly 30-40% of shares outstanding) is available to trade starting February 18th when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least, volatility caused by the uncertainty

**Financials and Valuation**

* **Starting off with the income statement,** the important things to note is that from 2018 to 2019, the company has grown revenue by about 25% while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses, which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of the company
   * The company has guided to $1.07 billion for the full year of 2020, which represents a 44% year over year increase and for a company with 1 billion in revenue, increasing revenue growth is a great sign
   * Comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019, the company was able to increase average revenue per customer by 38% and grew commercial revenue by 35% and government revenue by 68%
   * With all this said, one piece of concern in Palantir’s income statement is its net losses. The company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history, but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation
* **Moving onto its latest cash flow statement,** what you mainly need to know is that the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing, so if you were to add that back, the company is essentially near break-even
   * However, the company’s free cash flow (operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures) is negative, so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior
* **Lastly, Palantir has a great balance sheet**
   * With $1.8 billion in cash and only $200mm in debt, the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth
* **Regarding the company’s valuation,** while the company is growing nicely at 44% from 2019-2020, and is expected to grow 31% from 2020-2021 based on street estimates, it currently trades around a 45x NTM sales multiple depending on the day, which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market
   * The key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best-in-class software or wait for a better entry point?

**What I’m Doing**

* Personally, I can't justify Palantir's valuation, which may sound a little old-school but I think there are better opportunities out there
* However, in the long-run I am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the 20s (and teens if it somehow falls down to that)
* I'm also closely monitoring what happens after earnings (2/16) and next week the lock-up expires on 2/19 so it'll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then

**TLDR:** Palantir has a best-in-class, sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side (where it's pretty much a monopoly) and businesses (which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce). Growing healthy top-line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies. I am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities.

So I'm aware that theta decay is the time value of an option and the closer you get to expiry the more the value of the option drops if it hasn't met the strike price yet.

My question is are any of those losses permanent? I've found that my options tend to ""step"" down day on day and it doesn't seem like it gets back to the same level as the day before even if the value of the stock I hold options on nears the strike price. Is this just the effect of the compounding of the averages of all of my call options that suffer theta decay?

At this point the only key measure to look at here is **market cap:**  we are looking at a $768B company, almost $1T. In case you haven't noticed, there aren't a lot of companies thare are worth significantly    more than that. Only  AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and Saudi Aramco thare are worth  more than double the price of TSLA, and they are all cash cows with massive amounts of actual real profits and fat margins, something that  Elon Musk doesn't have.

Even if TSLA stock rallied heavilyin the next months, it could as well double and go into the same league as those blue chips, but **REALISTICALLY,  it's not a 10 bagger potential ANYMORE: do you actually believe that  there would be LITERALLY TRILLIONS of dollars flowing into this stock?** Because to increase its price we need those numbers at this point.

Really  think about the people that could buy TSLA at this point, basically  everybody knows it's a massive bubble, and it's much easier to justify  taking  that massive risk if you know you could be in for a multibagger  upside wise, but  it's not easy given the relatively small upside of  today.

Having said all that,  there needs to be a catalyst. In the next few years, as competiton in  EV and autonomus driving space starts to thicken, we  might  finally see  a meltdown ...

Burry shorted this a couple of months back, he  predicted  2008, he  predicted Game Stop, he might be right on this  too.

Who they are and the market situation:

CTHR is a US based jewelry company specializing in moissanite and synthetic lab grown diamonds. They've been around since 1995, but have only recently begun to grow with the growth of the synthetic diamond market.

The lab grown diamond industry is growing quickly, by 2030, the [global market volume of lab-grown diamonds](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1078280/global-market-volume-of-lab-grown-diamonds/) is forecast to be nearly 19.2 million carats, compared to its current 6.2 carats. The technology to produce synthetic diamonds is rapidly growing, it already takes mere weeks to produce from start to finish today.

As a company that got a foot in the door early on (in my non-professional opinion) Charles and Colvard are in a fairly good position to continue to grow and maintain a solid holding in the new synthetic diamond industry over the next decade.

TL;DR: If you're wanting to get into the gemstone stock long haul, in my personal opinion, indicators look to point that CTHR should do fairly well over the next 10 years."|investing|In honor of upcoming Valentines Day, lets take a look at CTHR again|11.0|0.73

I took the most important ones and updated it for the current market.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Things that have never happened before are bound to occur with some regularity. You must always be prepared for the unexpected, including sudden, sharp downward swings in markets and the economy. Whatever adverse scenario you can contemplate, reality can be far worse.

Nassim Taleb calls these “Black Swans”:  an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight)hindsight. Examples would be the Internet, the personal Computer, World War I, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and of course the Coronavirus.

These all changed countries or continents for decades.  With shutdown still in place in several countries in the world the economy’s output is much lower than it was at the end of 2019 -  yet we reached an all time high in the stock market. New Mutations are evolving and there might be a sharp downturn in the future or there might not. History taught us that market crashes are much more common than we think. So it is important to be diversified in different asset classes, industries and countries to be protected against those changes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When excesses such as lax lending standards become widespread and persist for some time, people are lulled into a false sense of security, creating an even more dangerous situation. In some cases, excesses migrate beyond regional or national borders, raising the ante for investors and governments. These excesses will eventually end, triggering a crisis at least in proportion to the degree of the excesses. Correlations between asset classes may be surprisingly high when leverage rapidly unwinds.

With interest rates in Europe being partly negative and extremely low in the US, people are lulled into borrowing to get onto the Party of rising stocks, and that on margin. Margin on Portfolio reached an all time high in December of 2020 and the number of retail traders thanks to Robin Hood exploded even with the recent controversy. In addition - central banks in Europe and the US are printing money like there is no tomorrow. These money policies have driven stocks to a new high. And the excess of government debt mirrored that progression. Action always have consequences - but however harsh they may be one thing is certain: If the current price is higher, the returns won’t be as great in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nowhere does it say that investors should strive to make every last dollar of potential profit; consideration of risk must never take a backseat to return. Conservative positioning entering a crisis is crucial: it enables one to maintain long-term oriented, clear thinking, and to focus on new opportunities while others are distracted or even forced to sell. Portfolio hedges must be in place before a crisis hits. One cannot reliably or affordably increase or replace hedges that are rolling off during a financial crisis.

We all chase profits, that is just how it is. However conservative positioning and a long-term oriented perspective is crucial. Most people in 2000 thought they would buy the dip when their favourite stocks started to decline, however the decline didn’t stop. The Nasdaq posted a loss of 77%, which would take 15 years to regain the dotcom bubble. During the financial crisis many couldn’t sell their stock because there were no buyers - even retail investors that thought they could get out couldn’t.

During it Janus Funds were similar to ARK today. Investing in modern technology companies and industry they were one of the top cutting edge technologies. Janus were lauded as great money managers but the end of the bubble resulted in brutal loses. Cathie Wood is one of the smartest investors today, but one has to keep in mind the inherent risk that comes with her investment strategy.

Similarly we saw extreme loses in GME. Chasing after returns purely on performance will not result in great results.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Risk is not inherent in an investment; it is always relative to the price paid. Uncertainty is not the same as risk. Indeed, when great uncertainty – such as in the fall of 2008 – drives securities prices to especially low levels, they often become less risky investments.

This is the quintessential art of investing. Your returns will entirely depend on what price you paid. Microsoft was a great company, but buying it during the dotcom bubble would leave you 15 years with no returns and several other well known companies like Cisco or Intel never reached their dot-com peak. Your returns are entirely dependent on the price you pay and so is the risk factor.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not trust financial market risk models. Reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled. Attention to risk must be a 24/7/365 obsession, with people – not computers – assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time. Despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics, the markets are governed by behavioral science, not physical science.

Because of this behavior we see certain securities being extremely highly valued like Zoom at the moment and certain sectors being very depressed like oil until recently. Yet oil is seen as extremely risky, even though the projected use of oil will increase in the next 10 years. That means that you can find bargains all the time. Those bargains are declared risky -  while the overvalued stocks are declared safe. Microsoft after the dotcom bubble only recovered in 2016. 15 years of no gains at all -  yet now Microsoft is treated like a company that will be a great stock forever. It is a great company, but the same was thought about companies like Polaroid or Kodak - we saw how it turned out.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not accept principal risk while investing short-term cash: the greedy effort to earn a few extra basis points of yield inevitably leads to the incurrence of greater risk, which increases the likelihood of losses and severe illiquidity at precisely the moment when cash is needed to cover expenses, to meet commitments, or to make compelling long-term investments.

This can be highly dangerous and I see it all the time here on reddit. Someone wants to use the money in 3-5 years to buy a house, yet instead of proposing a portfolio that is safe and diversified in several asset classes, most propose a stock only portfolio and sometimes even sector or ARK ETFs. Research has shown that a stock only portfolio will beat pretty much every other asset allocation -  that is over the long term. Due to the ups and downs of the market it doesn’t guarantee returns in 3-5 years or even worse can lead to loses. From 1929-1954,1973-1982 and from 2000-2013 the S&amp;P 500 has shown long stretches of no absolute return. Investing before a correction that you cannot foresee would result in either big loses or in the inability to purchase that house -  often both. So be conservative when you need the money.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The latest trade of a security creates a dangerous illusion that its market price approximates its true value. This mirage is especially dangerous during periods of market exuberance. The concept of ""private market value"" as an anchor to the proper valuation of a business can also be greatly skewed during ebullient times and should always be considered with a healthy degree of skepticism.

This is especially true today. Many stocks are currently at outrageous prices. I don’t talk about the FANGMAN stocks -  these have great growth and while still being historically overvalued not outrageously so. Several EV/Green/Biotech/Weed/Technology stocks are seen as the next big Google without decent cash flows and while competing in the same space.

This is especially true for unprofitable companies at the moment. According to Joel Greenblatt:  If you bought every company that lost money in 2019 that had a market cap over $1 billion, and so they’re about 261 companies, you’ll be up 85 percent so far until today. Something like that won’t be sustainable.Looking at the fundamentals behind the business often makes it clear how unreasonable some of these numbers are - and what returns should be expected of them (often negative)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You must buy on the way down. There is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up, and far less competition among buyers. It is almost always better to be too early than too late, but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy.

We saw that during the financial crisis and also again in 2020. Those that bought on the way down were generously rewarded. You never know when the bottom will hit especially since everyone will run around in panic like a beheaded henn. Researching the fundamentals of a company one can score great businesses for cheap. However they might go down a bit in the short term due to market panic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Financial innovation can be highly dangerous, though almost no one will tell you this. New financial products are typically created for sunny days and are almost never stress-tested for stormy weather. Securitization is an area that almost perfectly fits this description; markets for securitized assets such as subprime mortgages completely collapsed in 2008 and have not fully recovered. Ironically, the government is eager to restore the securitization markets back to their pre-collapse stature.

As SPACs and Bitcoin dominate the current market this warning is very important. SPACs and the companies behind them haven’t had the greatest return over the long term. With the explosion of SPACs going public, chances are high that those financial products can be very dangerous. Add the risk that SPAC managers often get big compensation packages and try to hide information to increase the price (DOJ Investigation from Clover), these investments should be taken with the utmost caution. Not only that but they also compete in the same space.

The same applies to bitcoin. While I believe that cryptocurrencies will have a bright future, they have yet to be tested during prolonged market downturn where the market was negative not just a few week but several months or even years. No one know what the price will be then and some investors might wake up to a bad surprise. It is important to know these risks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ratings agencies are highly conflicted, unimaginative dupes. They are blissfully unaware of adverse selection and moral hazard. Investors should never trust them.

That what makes short seller research so important. While there are a lot of crocks in the financial market (both on the long and the short side), these people often find what the rating agencies or investment banks ignore. If you invest into a company and there is a short report don’t dismiss it - often they include information that was previously overlooked.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Be sure that you are well compensated for illiquidity – especially illiquidity without control – because it can create particularly high opportunity costs.

The OTC market absolutely exploded in 2020. Many of these are highly illiquid. Be prepared for the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Beware leverage in all its forms. Borrowers – individual, corporate, or government – should always match fund their liabilities against the duration of their assets. Borrowers must always remember that capital markets can be extremely fickle, and that it is never safe to assume a maturing loan can be rolled over. Even if you are unleveraged, the leverage employed by others can drive dramatic price and valuation swings; sudden unavailability of leverage in the economy may trigger an economic downturn.

Everyone takes debt at the moment. It is so cheap that many companies use debt to do buybacks or otherwise increase their price. Other people trade on margin and governments don't seem to care about debt. That can be highly dangerous. No one can control interests rates over the long run and bankruptcy is the most surefire way to delete any investment returns. Peter Lynch said: “If you have no debt it is very hard to go bankrupt”. While businesses with little or no debt might not rise to the same degree, they will reduce the chance of a wipeout significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When a government official says a problem has been ""contained,"" pay no attention.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The government – the ultimate short-term-oriented player – cannot withstand much pain in the economy or the financial markets. Bailouts and rescues are likely to occur, though not with sufficient predictability for investors to comfortably take advantage. The government will take enormous risks in such interventions, especially if the expenses can be conveniently deferred to the future. Some of the price-tag is in the form of back- stops and guarantees, whose cost is almost impossible to determine.

We saw that in March the Fed stepped in and bailed out the market. A decrease in interest rates and intense money printing. However the question is: How long can it continue and what will happen to those expenses in the future? All action has consequences and we saw that some of them can end quite bad.

Seth Klarman also added some false lessons, that are relevant without commentary.

**False Lessons**

1. There are no long-term lessons – ever.
2. Bad things happen, but really bad things do not. Do buy the dips, especially the lowest quality securities when they come under pressure, because declines will quickly be
3. There is no amount of bad news that the markets cannot see past.
4. If you’ve just stared into the abyss, quickly forget it: the lessons of history can only hold you back.
5. Excess capacity in people, machines, or property will be quickly absorbed.
6. Markets need not be in sync with one another. Simultaneously, the bond market can be priced for sustained tough times, the equity market for a strong recovery, and gold for high inflation. Such an apparent disconnect is indefinitely sustainable.
7. In a crisis, stocks of financial companies are great investments, because the tide is bound to turn. Massive losses on bad loans and soured investments are irrelevant to value; improving trends and future prospects are what matter, regardless of whether profits will have to be used to cover loan losses and equity shortfalls for years to come.
8. The government can reasonably rely on debt ratings when it forms programs to lend money to buyers of otherwise unattractive debt instruments.
9. The government can indefinitely control both short-term and long-term interest rates.
10. The government can always rescue the markets or interfere with contract law whenever it deems convenient with little or no apparent cost. (Investors believe this now and, worse still, the government believes it as well. We are probably doomed to a lasting legacy of government tampering with financial markets and the economy, which is likely to create the mother of all moral hazards. The government is blissfully unaware of the wisdom of Friedrich Hayek: “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.”)

Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) reported earnings for the fourth quarter on Feb. 10. Despite posting another big loss, as the market expected, the ridesharing leader promised investors that profitability is at last on the horizon. Indeed, Uber claims to still be on track to achieve profitability in 2021 on an adjusted basis.

Adjusting to losses

When public companies report earnings, they are required to use an accounting standard known as generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP accounting allows analysts and investors to evaluate corporate performance across a range of businesses and industries with a common set of assumptions and definitions. On a GAAP basis, Uber lost $968 million in the fourth quarter, which is largely in keeping with its performance in recent quarters.

Uber, however, does not confine itself to merely reporting GAAP earnings. Like many other companies, Uber also likes to include a number of non-GAAP metrics, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Such adjustments can, according to writer and analyst Will Kenton, make it more accurate measure of financial performance than ordinary Ebitda:



""The adjusted Ebitda measurement removes non-recurring, irregular and one-time items that may distort Ebitda...Standardizing Ebitda by removing anomalies means the resulting adjusted or normalized Ebitda is more accurately and easily comparable to the Ebitda of other companies, and to the Ebitda of a company's industry as a whole.""




With an adjusted Ebitda loss of $454 million in the fourth quarter, less than half the loss it booked on a GAAP basis, it is easy to see why Uber has been a fan of the metric since before it went public.

Promised profits encourage analysts

Even on an adjusted basis, Uber has continued to post steep losses, but that may soon change. Company management has repeatedly promised that positive earnings are near at hand. This prospect has been met with an enthusiastic response from Wall Street, garnering a number of analyst upgrades ahead of its latest earnings print.

Despite the challenges presented by the economic and social disruptions of 2020, Uber is still on track to achieve positive adjusted Ebitda in 2021, according to Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai. In the company's Feb. 10 earnings press release, Chai reiterated the goal of turning the corner on profitability this year, if only on an adjusted basis:



""In Q4 we continued to deliver improving Adjusted Ebitda performance, up $171 million quarter-over-quarter, and remain well on track to achieving our profitability goals in 2021.""




Uber's continued confidence appears to have kept most analysts onboard in spite of a somewhat lacklustre overall result in the fourth quarter. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak, for example, declared in his post-earnings update that Uber's ""mixed"" financial results failed to undermine his confidence in the company's ability to scale its operations profitably.

When a profit is not a profit

While creative Ebitda adjustments are far from uncommon in corporate finance these days, Uber's approach has raised several eyebrows. The ridesharing company has actually become somewhat notorious among finance sleuths for its aggressive accounting practices. Indeed, as Jordan S. Terry of Stone Street Advisors observed on Feb.11, Uber has a track record of rather ""breathtaking levels of audacity"" on that front.

Of key importance is Uber's exclusion of stock-based compensation from its adjusted Ebitda calculation. While SBC is technically a non-recurring expense in a corporate accounting sense, it has been standard practice at Uber and shows no sign of stopping. On Feb. 11, stock market analyst Keubiko delivered a particularly withering assessment of Uber's ignoring key expenses:



""UBER is going for the gold in the Adjusted Ebitda Olympics. Highly profitable if you ignore the expenses.""




Uber is effectively ""adjusting"" a significant portion of its expenses out of existence with, at best, a tenuous justification. As legendary short seller Jim Chanos (Trades, Portfolio) pointed out on Feb. 11, negating the adjustment turns Uber's promised profitability into still more losses:



""When UBER says it will be 'profitable' in 2021, that means they will lose $300-400 million in the 4Q.""




My verdict

At its most basic, profitability is a fairly black and white affair. A company either makes a profit or it does not. While the prospect of Uber's near-term profitability may encourage some analysts and investors at first glance, a closer look at how the company intends to calculate that profitability probably ought to give them pause.

In my assessment, Uber's reliance on questionable adjusted Ebitda metrics to define its profit trajectory could prove problematic over time. While improving adjusted Ebitda can point the way to eventual profitability, the company will only truly be profitable when it can deliver positive earnings on a GAAP basis. There is little prospect of that happening anytime soon.

Since the report, it has risen 8.74% in the after-hours, putting it at $16.79. That's a 60% potential gain at a PT of $27.

This stock ran to $23 in November off a $26 pt from Credit Suisse. A couple $15-16 targets sent this into a long accumulation range that its finally ready to break out of.

Fisker has failed previously with car companies specifically, so why is it different this time?

Apex Technologies / AvePoint Inc.

In November of 2020 AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider announced a $2B merger with Apex Technologies. The deal is expected to close this quarter and AvePoint will begin trading under the new ticker AVPT.

Why is this one of the most undervalued SPACs right now?

1.) All Star Leadership

Both Apex and AvePoint boast great leadership teams. At Apex, Jeff Epstein (lol), serves as the co-CEO and CFO. Jeff has held board/executive positions at companies such as Oracle, Twilio, Nielsen, Booking Holdings among others. The other co-CEO, Brad Koenig has served as the Global Head of Technology Investment Banking at Goldman Sachs for 15+ years and has served clients such as Dell, eBay, Microsoft, SAP, Veritas, Oracle in advisory capacities. Both Jeff and Brad will join the board of AvePoint once the merger goes through.

The current CEO of AvePoint Tianyi Jang, who's 23 years in the industry include positions at Deutsche, Lehman Brothers, and Citadel will remain as the CEO. The rest of the executive team boast past positions at companies such as Deloitte, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Verizon, Merril Lynch and many others.

2.) Total Addressable Market

We all know how huge cloud computing is and will continue to be through the future. This is no new news. AvePoint estimates their TAM to grow to over $33B by 2022. As a strategic cloud partner of Microsoft and a 5x Global Partner of the Year Recipient, they're very well positioned to grow along side Microsoft and the cloud computing space as a whole. This growth is only being accelerated by the pandemic.

[https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/covid19-cloud-infrastructure.html)

This partnership also allows a large competitive advantage as AvePoint offers the only full suite of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage, and secure data in Microsoft 365. Within the 7mm cloud users, previously mentioned there's some blockbuster Fortune 500 companies relying on AvePoint's technology everyday.

3.) Financials and Growth

Full Year Total Revenue for 2020 closed somewhere between $148M and $151M, up 29% year over Year. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short Term Investments total approximately $70M as of December 30, 2020 with a \~14% EBIT margin. The company also remains completely debt-free.

With an additional $252mm in cash on its balance sheet from the transaction, there will be plenty of room to grow. Some of the avenues AvePoint plans attacking include; selling more to existing customers, increasing SMB footprint, capturing a larger share of the Microsoft Cloud Customer Base (currently only 3% with no meaningful competition in the space), and expanding target industry focus and international targets.

Been holding 200 shares since late November and am shocked this merger isn't getting more attention. In the year of the SPAC, this one stands out as one of the best. I see at as a great simultaneous growth and value play and wanted to share. Cheers.

[Chart](https://ibb.co/WG29fWx)

Since I entered my trade it hasn't gone down, but since I've been in,  I've been seeing clear manipulation holding it down to these levels. Options expire tomorrow too.

BP has a bad rep among oil company investors because of their transitioning to green energy by 2030. So many point to Exxon Mobil as being the clear pick for a long term hold if oil is your thing, which is probably true especially with oil being at pre-pandemic highs at the moment, however I'm not long term anything, swing trading is my thing. 

Oil prices did spike my interest with BP regardless, I also saw BP as the most undervalued major despite recording its first annual loss in a decade, the reporting of which didn't drop it below resistance levels.

I started doubting my entry of BP as the stock drifted sideways for most of the week. I had a brief moment of hope on Monday that I'd get a quick flip and an early exit when the stock spiked 6% on news of BP securing offshore wind deals, but I wanted more and since then it was pushed back down and consolidated.


Exxon Mobil had an ex dividend on the 8th of feb and up to ex dividend, starting on the 29th of Jan it had a massive run up. BP ex dividend is on the 18th of Feb  and I'm expecting a similar run up. Expecting the price to rise next week as the shorts close for Ex Divi day. If they don't then they'll have to foot the Divi bill to shareholders. I also expect some retail dividend flippers to hop onboard during the run up pushing prices up further. I'll be closing my position on the 18th and looking for a new opportunity.

 &amp;nbsp;

**Space Industrialization**

 &amp;nbsp;

I want to start by noting that I think the industrialization and commercialization of space is a sector that is going to see tremendous growth in our lifetime. The current size of the global space economy is expected to grow from an estimated $415 billion to $1.4 trillion by 2030, driving demand for transportation and infrastructure services in space. It is clear to me why Cathie Wood is introducing an ARK Space Exploration ETF, since this will be another booming industry. I'll share a quote from Elon Musk:

 &amp;nbsp;

*""You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.""*

 &amp;nbsp;

The colonization of Mars is going to be one of mankind's greatest challenges and an objective that I strongly believe is achievable in a few decades. But it's not just Mars, it's the entirety of space that has virtually endless opportunities for growth. NASA, SpaceX, Starlink, Virgin Galactic, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Astra, and many more companies are at the forefront of making this possible. But there is one that really intrigues me: Momentus. 

 &amp;nbsp;

**What is Momentus?**

 &amp;nbsp;

*""As we continue to develop new technologies and improve the capabilities of our rides, we will continually introduce more services, each contributing to the further industrialization of space. To realize a future where humanity is equipped with all it needs to flourish throughout the solar system, we need to be able to mine, manufacture, build, and generate power in space. Momentus will make this possible.""* - Momentus 

 &amp;nbsp;

[Momentus](https://momentus.space/), founded in 2017, provides infrastructure services necessary to facilitate the inevitable need for space industrialization.  Their core service is in-space transportation. What are some of their services?

 &amp;nbsp;


* Space transportation services - first hub and spoke model of space, providing last mile delivery in partnership with key launchers, such as SpaceX

* Satellite as a service - hosted payload services that significantly decrease the cost of developing, launching and maintaining satellites

* In-orbit services - maintaining, repairing and refueling satellites in orbit

 &amp;nbsp;

There is a lot more really cool stuff they are envisioning to do, like equipping vehicles with robotic arms capable of performing proximity maneuvers, docking, and refueling. They also expect that extending the lives of larger spacecrafts, relocating or deorbiting satellites, conducting salvage missions, robotic repairs, etc. will be done in a day's work for their service fleet. Momentus stands apart from other companies because their whole business strategy revolves around space infrastructure services, which is only going to become more and more necessary as the space economy becomes further and further developed. They have a key partnership with a few companies, most notably SpaceX, and many customers such as NASA and Lockheed Martin. 

 &amp;nbsp;

I urge you to take a look at their [investor presentation](https://momentus.space/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Momentus_Investor_Presentation_2020_10_12.pdf), as there is some seriously cool things they are working on that will make Momentus one of the leading space industrialization companies in the world. The last page includes their financial forecasts, which I am not taking too seriously right now given this is an up and coming sector with massive potential.

In my opinion the lack of broad coverage by analysts and very conservative management have kept the true value of the company hidden.

Here’s a reason why management is conservative:

•	⁠They only expect 10% growth for 2021 (+$32m)

•	⁠Note that Microsoft deal alone would add +$28m (8%) based on the earnings call. I think this deal is a solid proof of the company’s performance, not only Microsoft extended the period (from 3 years to 4 years), they also expanded Perion’s service from 6 countries to 30+ countries.

•	⁠CTV is having $6m revenue last quarter, growing 130% from previous quarter. I wouldn’t be surprised if this segment alone would print $12-15m by Q4 2021 (pretty conservative estimate of the 100-150% growth YoY, note from 130% QoQ), or additional $20m for the whole year (+6%)

•	⁠Display and social advertising revenue increased by 159% YoY ($26m to $68m per quarter). I think the overall advertisement budget would continue to shift to social medias from traditional venues. Even a 10% YoY growth seems very conservative (additional $24m for the whole year, or 7% from total).

•	⁠Now even with the above conservative assumptions, we’re looking at 20% revenue growth. I think it would be easy for the company to achieve higher growth.

In the United States, more than 10 investment companies have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for similar products. Last month, President Joe Biden appointed a new SEC chair, prompting hopes that a bitcoin ETF could be approved in 2021.

The OSC’s approval of BTCC could nudge other markets to see similar products come to light.

“The SEC will definitely feel the pressure to allow such a product to come to the marketplace because there are already products in the market that are taking advantage of the exposure of bitcoin that are not efficient for investors and are not being done in a regulated format like the SEC would want,” he said.

Bitcoin holdings are kept in “cold storage” – an offline custodian that cannot be hacked. Gemini Trust Company LLC will be sub-custodian for the fund, and CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Co. will act as fund administrator.

Disney’s Media and Entertainment Distribution, which includes Disney+, brought in $12.66 billion for the quarter, a decline of 5% from the same quarter a year ago before the pandemic swept across the country. The Disney Parks, Experiences and Products unit took in $3.6 billion, down 53% year-over-year as many Disney parks and its cruise line remain closed. The flagship Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., and Disneyland Paris will stay closed in the current quarter, Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said during the analyst call.

Now I know, I know the adage ""It's not timing the market, it's time in the market"" and to insulate yourself from all of the finance news and predictions, **BUT** given the uniqueness of COVID and the resulting cash injection from governments, the recent speculation of inflation or even hyperinflation is hard to look away from.

I don't want to buy a house (don't want to be tied down, plus I'm single) and the stock market is at an all-time high right now.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this; I've been eyeing Rigel Pharmaceuticals (ticker: [RIGL](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/RIGL:NASDAQ?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjs1ejg2eLuAhXhMVkFHTeHBN8Q3ecFMAB6BAgHEBk) ) and wondering why Yahoo Finance has it set as a strong buy (1.7 on the recommedation rating).  I decided that this would be a good first time time to try some FA and exercise some financial DD.  I also have some positions for RIGL that I bought just for shits and gigs (8 shares @ $3.45).

Intro:Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a biotechnology company dedicated to discovering, developing and providing novel small molecule drugs that significantly improve the lives of patients with hematologic disorders, cancer and rare immune diseases.  They are headquarter in South San Francisco, CA.

Products and its uses:Based on their website ([https://www.rigel.com/pipeline/](https://www.rigel.com/pipeline/)) they have 6 products in the pipeline, but they seem to be putting all their efforts on  TAVALISSE® (fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate) tablets, which has been designated by the FDA as first-in-class medication.  This is important since this drug will have the market cornered for its specific use until 2032 (per their investor relations January 2021 presentation: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_bef6964e32b3f4ed8a2db9acc82022c3/rigel/db/708/6000/pdf/Rigel+Corporate+Presentation-January+2021.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_bef6964e32b3f4ed8a2db9acc82022c3/rigel/db/708/6000/pdf/Rigel+Corporate+Presentation-January+2021.pdf))

Fostaminib is the first drug of its kind to manage ITP ( chronic immune thrombocytopenia), but has other uses too (I'm only naming 2 because these are the only ones I could fully understand from their presentation).

1. It is currently in phase 2 and 3 studies to determine that it can help prevent a type of cell death exclusively found in covid19 patients.
2. They will potentially be the first to market therapeutic for wAIHA (Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia), which is currently on its phase 3 study.

My personal insight into this business and investing in pharma:

Per Investopedia ([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/051316/industry-handbook-pharma-industry.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/051316/industry-handbook-pharma-industry.asp)), any sort of analysis on any pharmaceutical company needs to rely heavily on any readily available info regarding the drugs they have in their design pipeline.  And despite Tavalisse being designated as a first-in-class, you also need to be wary of up and coming innovator companies who are looking at blockbuster drugs and their manufacturers, and ultimately letting them pave the way so that said innovator can just follow in their footsteps and bring a better drug to market.  This includes

1. Getting rid of any sales inhibiting side effects
2. Following the established set of FDA required tests and trials that the first company had to deal with

So in other words, they're getting better at what they do and soon, they won't have to operate at a loss, assuming all goes well with Tavalisse/Fostaminib.  They did recently get granted some money by the DoD to fast track the phase 3 clinical trials for Covid19 treatments.

(so this is wear my FA gets funky).

Based on some FA articles I read, this is where we can get into the meat and potatoes of evaluating the price of a company.

First, I determine how much net cash the company has based on the difference between the current amount of cash/cash equivalents/ST investments they have and their total debt.

September 2020 cash/cash equivalents/ST investments: $72.8 millionSeptember 2020 debt: $41.1 million

Net cash = $31.70 million

Next up: assume the amount of money the company will make given a determined (or maybe even arbitrary) rate of return that would make you feel comfortable investing in them. For me, I used the discounted cash flow model and weighted average cost of capital rate to quantify this assumption. I also assumed that their net cash would increase by 2 million every year.

So, I modeled out the cash flow by using the discounted cash flow function on excel; I used 10.53% as the hurdle rate (or WACC) via [gurufocus.com](https://gurufocus.com) ([https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/NAS:RIGL/ROIC/Rigel%2BPharmaceuticals%2BInc](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/NAS:RIGL/ROIC/Rigel%2BPharmaceuticals%2BInc)) and made an assumption that a competitor would be coming in by 2026 with their own product (Note - I also know about the terminal value concept, but I didn't have the stomach to go through the formula derviation at this point in my FA, so I assumed that 2026 would be the end of Rigel's exclusivity on this treatment).

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Present Value of cash flow|$28.7 million|$30.8 million|$32.6 million|$35.3 million|$38.9 million|$43.4 million|

So the sum of the cash flows, inlcuding the net cash, is around $241.3 million.

Again, based on my quantified assumptions on how much money this company will make, I will now determine how much I should be willing to pay via a share price.

As of February 2021, there are 168,980,000 outstanding shares of this company.

So dividing the sum of cash flows by the # of outstanding shares landed me on $1.43 per share, which is vastly underpriced compared to what it's trading at.

SO! Despite my the errors known (application of the DCF model) and unknown (I didn't look at any potential sources of competition), this share price still makes sense to me because this company only has 1 major product in the pipeline that may (or may not) even work out, despite the DoD covid19 grant.

Additionally - a drug getting the first-in-class designation isn't necessarily a good sign if you consider cases where blockbuster drugs were eventually overtaken by a better alternative (Viagra to Cialis, for example).

So if there are any investors at this point that want to point out where I'm lacking in this FA and what I'm missing, I welcome any and all feedback!!

TLDR: I decided that RIGL is currently overvalued and is not even worth the long hold.

Founder Hugh Hefner died in 2017, the company stopped printing its famous men’s magazine last year and current CEO Ben Kohn has repositioned the firm as a consumer-products company rather than a publishing business.
“We’re not trying to be a magazine company. That doesn’t make sense to me,” Kohn, who will be one of the firm’s largest shareholders, told Seeking Alpha in an exclusive interview. “What makes sense to me is being the lifestyle platform that this business originally was.”
Playboy recently agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Mountain Crest Acquisition Corp. (MCAC) in a SPAC deal that values the company at about $381 million. The stock will begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq under the ticker “PLBY.”
MCAC raised some $50M through an initial public offering in June, and its shares rose more than 30% since the IPO to close Wednesday at $13.34 (see chart below).

As for Playboy, the firm still offers articles, adult pictorials and videos via Playboy.com, but Kohn said consumers also buy $3 billion a year of Playboy-branded products that the firm sells on its own or through licensees. He said that even in Playboy’s heyday as a men’s magazine, the company owned or licensed consumer businesses that ran the gamut from casinos to cufflinks that featured its iconic rabbit logo.
Kohn, who helped that Playboy private in 2011, said that when he first met the company’s legendary founder, “Hef said to me: ‘I might not be the best editor or the best publisher, but I am goddamn the best marketer.’ I think that’s what we’ve brought back to the company, which is really [to be] an aspirational lifestyle business.”
Despite the print magazine’s demise, 68-year-old Playboy remains one of the world’s best-known brands, with 97% of people around the globe recognizing the rabbit logo. Some 90% of customers are under 40, and women make up more than 40% of e-commerce sales.
Playboy-branded products sold online range from underwear to calendars to sex toys. Offline, a Chinese company operates more than 2,500 brick-and-mortar Playboy clothing stores in the Asian nation, while a partnership with Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) runs the Playboy Club London casino.
The revamped Playboy operates in four verticals:

Sexual Wellness. This includes products like Playboy condoms and sex aids. The company also recently signed a $25M deal to buy Lovers, a chain of 41 U.S. brick-and-mortar “sexual-wellness” shops.

Style and Apparel. The Playboy name is one of China’s top men’s fashion brands, sold through brick-and-mortar stores and more than 1,000 e-commerce sites.

Gaming/Lifestyle. Beyond its London casino, Playboy has partnerships with online-gambling software companies Microgaming and Scientific Games Corp. (NASDAQ:SGMS). The company is also working on online sports gambling, while in the lifestyles arena, Playboy sells furniture via Wayfair (NYSE:W).

Beauty and Grooming. Kohn said Playboy “has been an arbiter of beauty for 68 years,” and currently sells or is developing perfumes, skincare products and cosmetics.

The CEO said that simply by tapping into the growing direct-to-consumer trend, the company can get a bigger share of the existing $3B revenue pie for Playboy-branded products while growing sales organically.
“We can drive the lifetime value of our consumers up because we can offer them multiple different products, whereas a licensee can only offer them one product,” he said.

Playboy recently released earnings for 2020’s third quarter and first nine months that showed big year-over-year gains. For instance, the company reported that net revenues rose 86% year on year in the third quarter to $35M, allowing the Playboy to turn a $1.3M profit vs. a $3.4M loss during the same 2019 period. And for 2021, the company is guiding to more than $160M in revenues and $40M of EBITDA.
Kohn said that when you add in more than $100M in working capital from the SPAC transaction and $180M of prior years’ carried-forward losses that will cut taxes, he sees big opportunities for growth ahead.
“The runway that’s in front of us is really endless,” he said.

## Coronavirus UK – Will Our Housing Market Crash 2020?

Until very recently, the UK housing market was at its strongest before the EU referendum.

It is good to be optimistic, however, that said we must not delude ourselves to the reality we face.

Few commentators, nevertheless, are making upbeat predictions for our housing market performance for the next 12 months.

Now there is a contraction of first-time buyers who are stung by the difficulty in getting low-deposit mortgages and the looming rise in unemployment.

However, Boris Johnson has recently said he would “turn generation rent into generation buy” via a return to 95% mortgages for first-time buyers.

This can only happen if the mortgage regulations are relaxed or as an alternative by providing direct government subsidies for first-time buyers adding to the various help-to-buy schemes.

### Things are getting worse and not better

Several months living with COVID-19 we are now seeing a clearer picture of the impact of COVID-19 has had on house prices. With the government intervention like the ongoing stamp duty holiday and the possibility of another national lockdown, the housing market could fluctuate in the months ahead.

The Land Registry’s UK House Price Index is a reliable barometer for house prices which is based on sold properties. It works on a two-month lag, so the latest available figures are for August.

The HM Land Registry figures reveal the price of a property in the UK increased by 0.7% month-on-month and 2.5% year-on-year in August 2020, to reach £239,196.

This might not last as the steam runs out of the broader economy. Experts believe the market (including house price growth) is likely to slow down once the government’s COVID-19 financial support to businesses employers, employees and the stamp duty cut comes to an end.

The Halifax says our housing market will eventually feel the effects of the economic downturn, with ‘greater downward pressure on house prices in the medium-term’.

The Nationwide opinion is that the winding down of government support schemes could ‘dampen housing activity’.

The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicts house prices could fall by 14% in 2021.

If we look at the broader picture now, things are getting worse and not better.

Many countries are already predicting a downturn in their housing market. At the bottom of this page, I have placed links to articles for 4 significant economies as a point of reference.

If we study the previous UK housing market crashes, we may get an idea of how serious the current crisis could get.

A 2020 housing market crash could be the worst market correction ever seen in the UK, according to Mr Richard Woolnough.

The Mr Woolnough, a bond manager at M&amp;G’s, believes house prices went up significantly ahead of the downturn. There is a chance they could decline to record lows, worse than seen in previous housing market crashes.

Mr Woolnough said: “History suggests that when the UK housing market crashes, it tends to fall about 25%-30% from peak to trough in real terms, but given that UK house prices rose about 270% from 1995 to end of 2007, there is a risk that this crash could be worse,”.

### IMF says UK housing 30% above model

“How far could UK house prices fall? The IMF said last autumn that UK house prices were 50% above where models suggested they should be, although this month, the IMF reduced that to 30%,”.

“Nobody knows how far prices could fall, as there is a considerable margin for error on long- term economic predictions.

“I believe this projection is likely to worsen because the banks are becoming increasingly reluctant to lend, which means mortgage approvals, and therefore house prices, could fall much further,” he said.

Recent data reveals that properties in London remain the most expensive at an average of £477,000, compared to the average of £247,000 in England."|investing|Is our housing market about to crash?|2.0|0.55

Gold is bought for two purposes, as an ""investment"" and for consumption (jewelry, electronics, healthcare, food). If all of the existing invested gold would disappear and people stopped buying gold as an investment, the market price of gold would give the intrinsic value.

Perhaps there's a way to estimate the amount of new gold production that is bought as an investment and use it to somehow estimate the hypothetical market price of gold, if the demand would be lower. This could be estimated by assuming some reasonable supply and demand curves based on available data. What do you think this intrinsic value would be compared to the current market price, perhaps 50% lower?

BTW, one thing related to this question that wasn't immediately obvious to me is that if the global wealth allocated to gold is stable over time (which may or may not be true), it means that gold doesn't just store its value but it appreciates."|investing|The intrinsic value of gold|16.0|0.79

Does anybody have any thoughts or experiences on mergers in Asia?

If we look at mergers in the USA and Europe for example, we will often have Company A (share price 100) and Company B (share price 50)

When  company A shows interest in buying company B, the share price of B will  go up to 60 or something like this. Then maybe a buyout is confirmed at  65 and the price settles at 62.50 until the merger is completed. In contrast, company A share price will usually drop until the merger is completed.

&amp;#x200B;

In Asia, things seem to work a lot differently from what i've observed.  Mergers, or a company going private are often lowball offers below the value of a company, or only a little higher.

These can sometimes cause companies to crash and other weird things to happen  such as the price to trade significantly below fair value or significantly below possible aquisition value.

Some recent examples I have are Vedanta which was trading at 6\~, buyout was offered  at 4.50 (unsucessful) and then the price went up to 8\~ after failure, now it's currently at 10 but some of this is macroeconomic impact imo.

CCRC has had a lowball buyout offer of $5.37 and is currently trading at  $4.55. Seems quite ridiculous as even if the merger fell apart you  wouldn't be too unhappy just holding a fairly solid company trading at 4 P/e with low debt.

If anyone was interested in joining the electric vehicle train but missed the start, now is your chance. This company recently went public via SPAC IPO. It initially jumped but has since settled. I see it taking off again soon. With a small market cap it could potentially be a 10-20 bagger.

Alternative similar company: XL ~ Same deal as above, just more focused on commercial electric vehicle fleet retrofits rather than battery tech. Also recently gone public via SPAC IPO.

The electric vehicle revolution is upon us, and while these aren't pure electric vehicle plays in the TSLA or NIO sense, they still have a lot of potential. There are a ton of existing commercial vehicles that need to be electrified.

  ETFs inflows pay a big premium to buy stocks and since they must buy when they get inflows this is by definition. As globally the AUM that ETFs manage is increasing at monstrous levels it poses a big threat to the equities market. If the markets turn sour, or if there's a shock that makes ETFs flows negative it is going to produce a downward spiral, big time. People/institutions if they want to unwind their investments in ETFs they must withdraw and thus the selling power will drive the market even lower.

Essentially the companies that are performing well are the ones that have stronger footings than others in a space rather than their underlying fundamentals. With long tech equities being the 2nd most crowded position (from a BofA survey of money managers for Jan) a lot of the subsectors like gene editing, electric cars (tech. auto), battery companies, and EV companies are performing because they have invested years in the technology. 

In conclusion, if this is the case then companies are more like research institutions then they are profit-making machines (normal framework under Freidman). With research institutions the more money and time you ""throw"" at a project the closer you get to getting it done.

\*\*Full disclosure: I own 75k in Toyota calls. I also own a Porsche and Audi (no Toyota products). I’m also not good with investing. So don’t listen to me.

Wow, some of the best plays truly are right in front of you, because Toyota is hilariously undervalued now that they’ve decided to enter the EV market.

Toyota, is an engineering and business legend. Nobody engineers better than Toyota, nobody optimizes businesses and Toyota.

When I went through business school we studied Toyota in almost ever classroom. Toyota practically invented modern business practices and engineering practices.

If you haven’t heard of Toyota as a professional in business or engineering, you should probably be fired.

The following statements may sound like opinions, I’m pretty sure they’re facts.

\- Dominates the manufacturing supply practice. Nothing is wasted in Toyota’s business, everything runs **LEAN and AGILE.** During economic downturns Toyota will always come out on top simply  because they’ve **perfected** the art of **efficiency**.

\- The finest engineers work at Toyota. Everything Toyota produces is an engineering marvel. Products optimized perfectly for each single demographic to be as affordable and reliable as possible  while being practical and usable.

Today, Toyota officially entered the EV business. The company with a perfect supply chain, the company with the highest amount of consumer trust, the company that has the finest engineers in the entire automotive industry and a practically infinite amount of wealth…has entered the room. So let’s look at their positioning.

\- Toyota is bound to be a huge recipient of the Biden’s plan to supply the federal government with EVs.

\- Fun fact, the top “American” companies are asian. The big three make most of their junk abroad.

\- Toyota is planning on being the **first** to deploy the **SOLID STATE BATTERY.**

**- MASSIVE Energy density** compared to existing technology.

\- Solid state batteries can easily reach **500+ mile range.**

\- **Much** faster charge time.

\- Have already begun the production process

\- Toyota plans on unveiling the first solid state powered EV this year with release soon after.

\- Toyota produces over 10,000,000 vehicles a year. Tesla reached 500,000 this year with a goal of 20% growth a year.

\- Toyota is the most trusted brand internationally in the automotive world.

So Toyota, a manufacturing behemoth is switching to fully electric with aims of putting their world class engineers to produce the world’s first solid state battery commercial vehicle. Nice.

Let’s talk about some numbers:

\- Price to book ratio of 1.137. Anything under 3 is considered undervalued. Tesla is around 40.

\- PE ratio of 17.17. Anything under 20 is undervalued, Apple is at 37 and **Tesla is 1301.**

**-** Expected to increase margin from 5.5 -&gt; 7.2

* 121% increase in operating income from China
* 24% Increase in cash/cash equivalents since Apr 2019. Impressive considering covid
* Relatively stable/balanced asset/liability ratio, has barely budged since covid).
* Has somehow decreased cost and expenses by 16% during covid.

If Tesla is the King Kong of the EV world, then Toyota is Godzilla, a nuclear powered dinosaur of a company from outer space. He’s landed and he’s gonna blow up your bubble. Yes I’m aware of the “Not just a car company” phrase, but as Burry said, “Enjoy it while it lasts”, because no company should be trading with a century of growth priced in.

This link is to a chart which appear to show cycles related to real assets (housing, property) and financial assets (cash, fixed income, mutual funds, equities, pensions, etc) on household balance sheets. This includes nonprofits, but this is minimal relative to households. Edit: The chart itself is financial assets as a percentage of total assets on HH/NP balance sheets, thus the remaining percentage is in real assets. 

Financial asset growth relative to real assets tends to be more aligned with periods of higher CPI relative to PPI (post 2008, years leading to tech bubble) and investments in financial products/securities, particularly, equities (60s, 90s, post 08).

Real asset growth relative to financial assets tend to be a function of higher PPI relative to CPI (70s/80s, post tech bubble), higher inflation rate (70s/80s), and household debt accumulation/tolerance relative to savings (housing bubble). 

I made a post recently about the health of the household balance sheet and the capacity of commercial banks to lend to households should debt tolerance grow. This would primarily be in the form of mortgage lending.

At the same time, the ratio of PPI to CPI is moving higher and other inflationary gauges along with it, e.g. 5y TIPS vs nominal treasury yields.

While continued fiscal stimulus in the form of economic impact payments are to benefit the financial asset category of the household balance sheet, how that money is used or utilized may be a catalyst for a shift in the performance of real vs financial assets; even so, should we move from what appears to be a consensus reflationary environment to an inflationary environment, this tends to bode better for real assets.

This is not a call of real assets outperforming financial assets, but simply observing the current cycle and possible dynamics that may indicate a change in cycle.

Hello Everyone,

Not sure if this belongs here or not so I apologize if this is in the wrong place.

For the past few days, I have been trying to learn more about DCF calculations in an attempt to get better at evaluating my own portfolio and analyzing stocks that I own and would like to purchase in the future. Currently, I have been watching a few videos and trying to practice calculations with Walmart and I am running into trouble when I am trying to calculate my future free cash flows for the company. In the video that I am watching the guy is taking free cash flow and dividing by net income and then using the most modest result to project future free cash flows. However, in my practice dividing Walmart's free cash flows by net income gives me three wildly varied percentages that I do not think will work for the rest of the calculation or lead me to an inaccurate result.

So with all that being said is there anyone here that could give me some advice on what I should do or a better way to estimate future free cash flows for a company?"|investing|Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Issue|2.0|0.75

I have been interested in this company for quite some time, as I had heard that they have an idea that will make recycling not only possible in today's US EV market, but profitable! If they can pull it off, they will be in a league of their own.


Join me, as I do my best at translating the science of recycling.


For this DD, I will focus on: THERMOELECTRIC POWER GENERATION AND MINERAL EXTRACTION FROM BRINES Patent Application (Application #20200279987). 


The novelty of this extraction method is exciting. Most methods today rely on brute force techniques such as acid baths or pyrolysis (using high temperatures to break down materials[dissolution]). What this patent details is a way to collect electricity as well as refine minerals through a series of hydrophobic membranes (thin filter sheets that allow some materials to pass through but not others) to separate desired products.


According to the patent, a thermoelectric (TE) module is used with one of the membranes to capitalize on the temperature differential and potentially generate electricity⚡. This means that the process of extracting lithium will yield energy, lowering the cost required for refinement.


*Ryan Melsert's patent mentions geothermal energy for base-load power generation. Could ABML&lt;ABTC be eyeing geothermal in the future? Is that possible around their first proposed plant in Fernley, NV?*


*I had recently read about some of the new tech that went into recovering shale oil products was slowly migrating into the rare earth metal mining industry. This patent mentions using 'brine from a well' to generate electricity and recover minerals. Being able to utilize injection fluids (the stuff that gets pumped down wells to loosen minerals and then gets sucked back to the surface to be refined) will be key.*


*I am concerned about the durability of ceramic permeable membranes. How expensive are they and who has the ability to manufacture them? Can they be cleaned and reused? Are they easily fouled by macromolecules such as bacteria, proteins, or polysaccharides?*

EVs will make up less than 10% of the U.S. market by 2025. US still will need a lot of EV charging stations. Biden's plan outlines 500,000 new EV plugs across the U.S by the end of this decade. With Biden's EV push, it is not surprising that investors have a very rosy expectation about EV charging business. As a result, a flourish of EV charging companies were brought to the market through SPAC mergers. 

I don't know what is the profit margin for EV charging stations, but one operating company Blink claimed to operate over 20,000 charging stations around the country, but that translated into less than $5 million in revenue over the past year. It currently has a market cap over 2 Billion dollars. Another EV charging company is offering Level 2 charging for free, and make their money from ads posted at their charge station.

Oil companies have a lot of experience in operating gas stations, so they have a good understanding of the kind of profit margins you can get from ""charging"" stations. For many gas stations, 75 percent of their profits comes from the sale of other products, such as food, medicine and accessories. I don't expect the stand-alone EV charge stations can have a high profit margin.

Oil companies and EV charging: Oil companies have started their carbon zero move. However, they are waiting in the wings milking their gas station infrastructure, until there are sufficient demand. Oil companies are not just sitting there waiting. Most of the European Oil companies have started their transition because Europe have a lot more EVs on the road today (Norway has more than 50%). In the US, Chevron has tried to convert a few gas stations in California to have EV charging stations, most likely to gain some experience and to gather market and profit margin data. Exxon is ""considering"", but has not moved yet."|investing|Oil companies and EV charging infrastructure|59.0|0.87
1613008029.0|0.0|t3_lh9vp2|216.0|"I’ve been wanting to do a post like this for a long time now. Now that healthcare has basically been the hottest thing for the last year (and somehow still getting even hotter), I thought it would be a good time. Many people try to buy into pharmaceutical companies around FDA approval targets without truly understanding what they’re getting into. Full disclosure, I am a doctor, but I will try to write this in layman’s terms as much as possible. If I get anything wrong, I’ll be sure to edit the post. To the best of my knowledge, everything I am about to say is researched (and therefore correct).

I’m going to go through the entire FDA approval process as a timeline, and then at the end, talk about other things to consider when investing in pharmaceuticals (i.e., more nuanced stuff that requires/applies healthcare understanding). One caveat here is people use “phases” in multiple ways. The way I will use it is the way I see most often being used in press releases and DD on reddit.

**Preclinical**: to begin, you must submit a proposal that basically states why you think a biologic compound will work. Without getting too technical, the preclinical is basically where you demonstrate a proof of concept. 

Here is a very generic example: Let’s say that HIV binds to GME receptor on cells. I have been doing petri dish experiments on a compound I created that prevents anything from binding to GME (this is *in vitro* if you ever see that term tossed around). I submit this evidence to the FDA and say that I think my compound will work in theory. TONS of things work *in vitro* and never progress beyond that. At this point, the FDA says, “okay we think your compound might work too, you can start human trials.”

&gt; Investor takeaway: the results of this phase mean absolutely nothing. If a drug failed in this phase, that would truly mean the company is incompetent in both their ability to assess the science, and in their ability to provide meaningful news to generate investor buzz. 

**Phase 1**: Anything that passes preclinical is ready for human trials. We are talking very small trials, like less than 100 people. For smaller companies, this is their chance to get some hype about their pharmaceutical. For anyone who understands the process, this is truly meaningless. Again, working in vitro does not (and likely will not) translate to working in humans. This phase typically lasts several months and is primarily designed to ensure that the drug is safe.

Here is a real life example, one that has already garnered a lot of attention: Atossa Therapeutics (ATOS) and their new breast cancer drug. Here is where medical knowledge (or solid research) can really help you. Their new breast cancer drug is called endoxifen. There are already multiple analogues (drugs that work in exactly the same way with minor differences in their chemical structures) on the market. Given the number of safe analogues on the market, it is likely (but not certain) this drug will be safe for human use. It is important to note here that phase 1 trials may be done on healthy participants without any disease, solely to test for safety. Accordingly, passage through phase 1 still may not demonstrate proof of concept on humans who have a particular disease.

Let’s say that ATOS had announced its intention to start testing breast cancer treatment and initiate phase 1 trials. Like I said, the likelihood of success is pretty high given the success of previous analogues. On the other hand the downside is huge. Companies can essentially go bankrupt at this stage if their “sure thing” drug or medical device fails. Always be sure to look at risk vs reward. A drug that enters phase 1 only has around a **14% likelihood** of making it all the way to FDA approval. Certain categories of drugs like those that treat cancer have even lower success rates (3.4%). While FDA drug approval does appear to be increasing **more than 80% of drugs that enter this stage will never see market.**

&gt;Investor takeaway: the road from here is super long and passing this phase really can’t tell you anything about its success in further stages. Many drugs are analogues and breeze through this phase, it is important not to get too hyped on them for that reason. 

**Phase 2**: Unlike phase 1 that focuses on drug safety, phase 2 tests the efficacy of the drug you are studying. This phase will typically have less than 1,000 participants, but they will all have the disease of interest. In this phase, we are looking to ensure that the drug works (provides statistically significant improvement) and is relatively safe as far as side effects. To limit research bias, sometimes we will divide the participants and give some the drug and keep some as the control group (they may get a placebo or no drug at all).

This is a pretty straightforward stage and lasts anywhere from months to years. It really depends on the drug being studied. I would never really expect a mainstream drug to get through this stage in under 6 months. The only conditions in which that would be logically feasible are either: 

1. COVID (solely because of the politicization of the process) or 
2. drugs treating conditions with extremely high mortality (because people won’t survive more than 6 months).

Lots of companies like to start releasing press releases close to FDA review of phase 2 results. Always be wary of those results. If my breast cancer drug was successful in 600 people and failed in 300, then while the numbers look good, the data may not be there. There is a lot that goes into statistical analysis and it isn’t quite as simple as more people did well than did poorly. 

It’s also important to realize that side effect profile is really important. Let’s say the aforementioned breast cancer agent ends up prolonging life in 80% of the study participants that received the drug. However, there’s also this nasty little side effect of developing a pulmonary embolism in 15-20% of people. That’s not insignificant and it is up to the FDA to decide whether or not the risk outweighs the benefit. Sometimes the FDA will order companies to redo this phase if the data are inconclusive. With cancer agents, this is common because the drugs are so toxic to so many parts of the body, so it really is about risk/benefit analysis.

The important thing to look at in this phase when comparing the results of the treatment group to the control group is what is called the p-value. For those of you who took stats, you should know what this is. For those that didn’t, just know that in healthcare, results with a p-value &gt;0.05 are considered insignificant. It’s also important to note that clinical and statistical significance are also key things to remember. Sometimes the benefit of the drug is so minimal that the side effect profile outweighs the benefits and the FDA will prevent the drug from moving forward. It’s also important to remember that if this is a drug entering a market where there are competitors, the FDA will look and see if this drug provides enough benefit over existing drugs before making a decision. 

One more nuance that pharmaceutical companies love to do is change the primary target. In the statistics world, that’s a pretty big no-no. If my initial proposal was that the breast cancer agent would prolong the life of my patients, and then suddenly I start talking about how it actually increases their pain-free time, this is a huge red flag. You can deduce that they likely didn’t meet their primary target and pivoted to something else they could meet. In any study you can find specific characteristic that makes you look good. 

&gt;Investor takeaway: this is the first phase that companies can really release “meaningful” information. Because of this, many companies try to raise funds at this time to capitalize on the hype, be wary of the words used in their press releases and marketing. 

**Phase 3**: Phase 3 is basically a repeat of phase 2, but bigger. It’s used to determine real efficacy of a drug. In raw numbers, we are looking at about 300-3,000 participants and up to 4 years of data. Phase 3 looks at the exact same things as phase 2: efficacy and side effects observed among a treated group (and sometimes compared to a control group).

Statistical significance, that is, the thing that tells you whether the drug worked, is based heavily upon power. If you want to increase power, you can increase the sample size. In phase 3, the FDA is giving the drug a chance to sink or swim. They are once again looking to make sure you don’t discover any new, obscure side effects and to ensure that the phase 2 results were not a statistical anomaly/the drug really does work.

Beyond sample size, the biggest difference between phases 2 and 3 is that we are observing a longer period of time for adverse events. Note the maximum time differences: up to 2 years for phase 2, and up to 4 years for phase 3. There are side effects that don’t manifest within the first 2 years. 
A very simple example is, actually cancer agents that cause cardiac fibrosis or pulmonary fibrosis after years of use. These are things that may have been masked in the phase 2 study because the duration. 

The other thing is that we may discover rarer, more deadly side effects in this phase. Let’s say in phase 2, we found that 2 of our 1,000 participants developed brain cancer. The phase 2 data may show that this was statistically insignificant and cannot be attributed to the drug (remember, sample size is very important). Maybe the phase 3 study will suddenly show that another 8 people developed brain cancer and it was due to the drug. 

&gt;Investor takeaway: many drugs fail here, and not because they don’t work. They fail because they aren’t significantly better than what is available or the benefit is not enough to outweigh the risks. FDA approval isn’t simply contingent upon a drug working, there are many, many factors that come into play. 

**Phase 4**: this is the big phase, thousands of participants, possibly multiple hospitals around the country/world. This phase further increases the power of the data and shows that the drug really, really does work and is actually safe. Getting to phase 4 is actually a pretty big deal.

At this point, the company will apply for FDA approval including all of the information they have gathered at this point. In this stage, we are considering not only efficacy and safety, but also simplicity of use, and drug abuse potential. Drug abuse potential is a pretty hot topic right now because, well, opioid epidemic. Many opioids in the last few years have not received FDA approval solely because they are too easily abused. This entire application process takes 6-10 months for the FDA to review all the evidence and decide what happens.

It is not uncommon for the FDA to request more data before approving a drug or further review. Many times they will request the company conduct a new study of x to determine y. This is normal but can seriously impede the approval timeline of a drug. This is where you have to remember opportunity cost. After approval it goes to market, yay!

&gt;Investor takeaway: you may think once the drug receives FDA approval that you are out of the woods in terms of your investment. You would be wrong. 

**Making it to market**: When a drug finally hits market, there are two major things for investors to consider. Let’s start with the scary one, removal from the market. Remember how many times I’ve mentioned power, and sample size above? That becomes super relevant here. Depending on the drug, when it finally reaches market we may have many-fold more “participants” with which we can study the side effects of the drug. 

Sometimes drugs are pulled from the market because certain side effects emerge that flew under the radar during clinical trial phases. Sometimes the FDA sticks a black box warning on the drug (which really makes doctors stop prescribing it unless they have to). In either care, share prices tend to drop. They will plummet, though, if the FDA removes it from market.

**Market earnings**: The last “opportunity” for investors in the approval process is the sales data after the first quarter of marketing. This is where the company shows their revenue from the sale of the drug. If you have medical knowledge, you can really thrive here. If you don’t, you are likely to get screwed because you probably won’t understand the nuances in what drives physicians to prescribe drugs and avoid others. 

Just because a drug works super well doesn’t mean it will ever be used. Examples of that are ACRX’s new sufentanil agents. Those will likely see poor sales data because from a clinical perspective, even though they are approved, and work, they will almost never be used. You would  not know that without understanding the specifics of post-operative pain management.

And finally, a disclaimer. Anything I said here, I can be totally wrong. Sufentanil could become the most popular agent on the market for reasons I don’t understand or couldn’t fathom. Maybe ACRX will have an insanely good marketing team. I am simply talking about making the best decision based on the available knowledge. Stock prices are fickle beasts and they don’t always respond the way we expect.

**A message to those who tend to hold on to their bags to gamble on FDA approval:**

&gt; Yes, this really is gambling. Look at the statistics of how often drugs make it past each stage. You lost 40% on ATOS, you know what would be worse? Somehow their drug fails and now you have lost 80%. You see a drug running before FDA decision deadline, don’t buy it. No one knows how the FDA is going to respond and you are just as likely to lose your money than you are to make it.

&gt; Honestly, you are more likely to lose money because there are three outcomes, and two cause you to lose money, one of which will potentially bankrupt your position. The FDA could either approve the drug (yay!), outright reject the drug (oof), or ask for more information. That last one is kind of misleading because it may not mean the drug has failed, but it definitely will destroy the hype built up and tank the share price. The extra information requested could take forever to get and you would, once again, have to consider opportunity cost.

Stating that employees can work from home indefinitely, even after the pandemic passes. I believe Google as made this announcement as well a few months back. I'm sure other companies will follow suite as well. 

It seems as though this pandemic has opened the eyes of upper management to the fact that WFH is possible, with minimal losses to productivity. What I suspect this will lead to in the future is a downsizing of corporate/business offices. Why pay for all the space when half your staff doesn't come in to the office anyway? Couple this with cloud computing/hosting, there is an increasing lack of need for physical office space over the next 5-10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other considerations**

While this business sector is downsizing it's real estate footprint, so too is the retail market. As companies struggle to compete with Amazon and online selling, it is becoming hard to justify keeping a physical stock on hand, in display, in multiple stores across the nation and world. Couple this with infrastructure and logistics of shipping to and from warehouses, liquidated unsold product, you name it. 

So the question I pose to you is this: When businesses in general reduce their real estate footprint, what happens to that physical land? And is there a way to invest in it's restructuring? There are plenty of shopping plazas across the US that lay barren, as all the shops have closed up. The landlords on that property are now running at a loss with no tenants. Shopping malls are closing, and have been for quite a few years. I believe that the corporate real estate world will start to follow in coming years. I don't believe it will be a complete desolation, but a definite downsizing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Where to park your money**

The only thing I would think would take their place is housing. Things like apartment buildings mostly. I have noticed an uptrend in a very specific kind of apartment complex becoming popular. A sort of 'mini downtown/city center' high-end luxury apartment. They will build about 3-4 stories tall, and leave the bottom floor available for business such as dry cleaners, small restaurants, or coffee shops. Although these are far from any city center, and act as a standalone building. It's actually quite weird. 

I am asking you all your opinions on the coming real estate market in these various business sectors. Do you know of any groups/companies/ETFs that could potentially stand to benefit and grow because of it?

From what I gather, the idea is this: 

Assume a merger agreement exists between A and B and for every 1 stock of B, shareholders of B will be issued 0.8 of A upon merging. 

A gap between A and B exists today where A is 1.5x the price of B. 

You decide to short 0.8x of stock A, and buy 1x of B to cover the shorts upon merger. 

This allows you to pocket the difference of (0.8 A - 1 B) at the current price of the transaction (today). 

In other words, you pocket (total short A - total long B) immediately, and your shorts will be covered upon merger so you have nothing to worry about even if prices change, because you will have the shares to cover (assuming the merger does happen as agreed).  


Am I correct?

The credit-card giant’s announcement comes days after Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.

Asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.

Mastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.

""Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,"" Mastercard said.

Mastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.

Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.

I see a lot of people use the term ""averaging down"" to try to lower their cost basis on a certain stock,  but in my opinion I don't think ""averaging down"" is actually a thing.

For example, say you invested $300 on 1 share of a certain stock X at its   peak, and  now the stock has dropped to $50 and you buy another share,   so now  you've ""averaged down"" your cost basis to $175. But really it   doesn't change the fact that you bought 1 share of stock X for $300.   That action is irreversible.

People who average  down hope that stock X can rebound to say $200, which is   higher than their current cost basis of $175, so technically you've   gained $25 per share, but in reality, you lost $100 on the $300 buy and   made $150 on the $50 buy.

So really the key decision of investment is all about the present, as in   this case: should I put $50 on stock X because I expect it to quadruple   to $200, or can I find another stock Y that I think will grow better   than that, to say, $300? Instead of thinking about the past irrevocable   buy they made at $300 and trying to think in terms of averaging down  the  cost basis. In fact, if they find that stock Y they feel will grow   better than stock X, the optimal decision would  actually be to sell   their formerly $300-now $50 share of stock X and put it into stock Y.

Tldr: when thinking about cutting losses, it's really about comparing rebound   potential of your declining stock vs potential growth of a promising stock."|investing|"Discussion on ""averaging down"" being a myth"|0.0|0.48

* Lebron James
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
* Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO &amp; COO

Here are the **highlights**:

""Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion.""

As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.

Beachbody is expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year.

""Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies""

Other awesome things about FRX:

* Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody [owns the majority stake in their shared company Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#Divisions))
* The company [also owns P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#History)

**My Due Diligence:**

The company is diversified between 3 separate companies, each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.

Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but its not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.

The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance

Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and a HEAVY digital marketing spend.

&gt; The real unemployment rate in the U.S. is closer to 10 percent, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday, after misclassification errors are factored in to the official government figure. The current unemployment rate, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics last week, is 6.3 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; ""We are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared,"" Powell said, in a virtual speech for the Economic Club of New York on the state of the labor market. ""The pandemic has led to the largest 12-month decline in labor force participation since at least 1948,"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; While the national unemployment rate has fallen from its March peak of 14.8 percent, it is still much higher than its pre-pandemic level. The unemployment rate in February 2020, before the coronavirus took hold of the economy, was just 3.5 percent, the lowest level in almost 50 years.

&gt; “Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy,” Powell said, stressing the importance of low interest rates. “It will require a society-wide commitment,” he added.

I think by normal Wallstreet metrics this company is extremely undervalued. My current position is 6 March contracts and 50 shares worth 30% of my portfolio (I'm not a wealthy man). 

First, this company has beat expected earnings [NINE consecutive times](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/UPLD/earnings/). Their earnings are coming up in late February and the implied volatility is currently extremely low, so the premium on options are cheap cheap cheap. And while I don't normally like to buy options before earnings, I think this is far enough out where the theta gang won't completely mess with my play. Second, they're a subscription based company so their revenue never really dips, it has only grown over the past three years (how often do you change insurance companies, or cancel your Netflix, or change internet providers, or hospitals leave EPIC?) Third, their free cash flow was upwards of $233 million in September for their last earnings, while their Price/Book ratio is currently hovering around 5.0. To put that P/B ratio into perspective, one of their main competitors, Smartsheet Inc. (SMAR) is currently hovering around 17.5.

So when analysts publish their expected EPS for Q4, I firmly believe this has not been factored into their price yet, since $50/share is nearly identical to where they were after their Q3 earnings report of 0.55EPS, which earned them the increase price target by analysts, and I expect EPS to **improve** considering that was the first quarter after they [sold 3.5Million shares to generate $119 million in cash](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/01/20/austins-upland-software-keeps-growing-acquires-second-street-media/4232372001/). And they've seen revenue improvement to the tune of $11M, $2M, $3M, $3M over their last four quarters, while seeing operating costs continually decrease.

Now back to free cash flow. With that money, UPLD has decided to acquire [Second Street](https://www.rbr.com/second-street-gets-purchased-its-an-upland-move/) for $25Million, which they expect to generate $9Million recurring revenue annually for them. Even at $25M that barely puts a dent into their FCF and won't be reflected until Q1 earnings, so their Q4 FCF will be fine, along with decreased operational expenses and forwarding losses against taxes. 

Their previous earnings calls did lend us some clues as to what to expect for Q4 as well:

&gt;In Q3, we had 35% growth in total revenue. We had 21% adjusted EBITDA growth. Now our EBITDA growth was lower than our revenue growth due to our ongoing sales and marketing investments and also a temporary uptick in CXM messaging costs based on the high election year volumes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Q3 cash flow was $18.5 million. We only had $3.6 million of acquisition expense in the quarter, and we had a little over $3 million of net positive working capital changes. And from this point forward, we're focused on generating material GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow, even after acquisition expenses, even after we turn the acquisition program back on. We completed in the third quarter a transformational equity raise. And we are now capitalized well enough to be able to grow double digits through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions for a very long time and are no longer dependent on the equity capital markets due to our free cash flow generation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our Q3 organic growth in reported recurring revenues came in at 14%. Now this recent acceleration in organic growth is all being driven by that bump in election year CXM usage by political campaigns and other advocacy organizations. And that usage has, to date, more than offset any COVID-related bookings and churn impact. And we see continued strengths in organic growth as we move into Q4, but we don't view this as any kind of a new normal for organic growth. Some of this election year usage bump will continue in 2021 as political campaign spending shifts to issue advocacy spending. But we can't say exactly how much, so we're going to maintain a conservative organic growth outlook for 2021.

Organic growth was excellent at 14% and their FCF gives them equity freedom, but the interesting part to me was the 21% ""inorganic"" growth due to political campaigns, which suggests that Q4 should also see an inorganic bump to revenue since Q3 was from June-September and Q4 includes October-December which is peak campaigning, followed by the Georgia runoff which lasted until January. They also specifically mentioned advocacy spending into early 2021. 

Finally, they're a small market cap at $1.5B, with a float of only 25.33M, of which [97.56% (24.71M) are owned by institutions or insiders, despite January's new short data suggesting that \~9% (2.22M) shares are shorted](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/upld/short-interest) according to NASDAQ. **\*Note, I think some of this data might be dated as MarketBeat has institutional holdings at 77.64%, which would change the total to \~94% shares owned\*** 

Let me be clear, I am not suggesting this play to cause a short squeeze, but I do find it interesting that there is supposedly only \~600,000-1.5M shares available unless you're buying from an institution, which is actually reflected in their average daily trading volume of &lt;300,000. For those that want to know who owns how many shares: [here you go](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/UPLD/institutional-ownership/). I also want to caution that if this play becomes popular, because there are limited available shares that this stock could become volatile very quickly, so proceed with caution. 

Indications my short term growth thesis may be **incorrect**: poor ROA, ROE, ROI historical performance, and consistent insider selling over the last two months (albeit incredibly small volumes). 

TL:DR - Bullish short term, bullish long term. Consistent growth due to subscription based services.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like this stock and see short term/long term value in it, so I've decided to make a play on it personally.

My focus has always been on re-investing into the company, but now that i'm past the start-up phase, my student loans are completed, I'm maxing out my 401k, and have a healthy low-interest mortgage - its probably time to take some calculated risk and invest in some aggressive stock opportunities.  


In the little reading that I've been doing over the past couple weeks, my interest is in a spread of ETFs - and all the ARK madness really good - but obviously past success does not indicate future potential here.... and if history has taught us anything, I imagine those stocks will hit a bubble at some point.  


So -- if you were me, and had \~$100k to invest in some shortish term aggressive stock --- would you risk it in a couple ARKs?  My 401k is really what matters for retirement, and my company is stable and will generate healthy revenue --- so I'm comfortable with an aggressive risk..... just feels like poor decision making to buy into something so big when it's at its peak.

Using ToS's thinkBack backtesting tool, I bought that ATM call option on $SPY dated for 1y out, with purchase date on Feb 19, 2020 (peak before the market crash to test the worst case scenario). Predictably, the P/L graph was negative during the market crash, but the graph slowly recovered and was a few thousand in the green after about half a year, confirming my idea that simply holding the option may often be enough to offset the loss. This was also true if you bought an ATM call at the dip (best case scenario), this time with a profit of over 10k per contract if you held til today--I was honestly expecting IV crush with the falling VIX to cancel any gains you'd get, so this surprised me.

My question is, how accurate are these numbers? I know ToS warns that this historical data doesn't necessarily translate to future performance. But my question is, is this is actual value of the call option at that point in time? Or is this simply what ToS has calculated that it may be worth based on the greeks at the time of purchase? 

I ask because a large portion of the value of the option in a 1y option is coming from gamma, which of course was not constant during the crash. So is it safe to assume that the values ToS uses were based on the *actual* greeks for the option *at each point in time*, or simply what they calculated based on the initial greeks at the time of purchase?"|investing|ThinkOrSwim thinkBack data accuracy|9.0|0.81

Using Yahoo Finance historical data for VTI over the past 5 years, I ended up answering this question plus diving deeper to make a few other random observations. Here is what I found:

* **What day of the week is best to buy VTI for dips?**
   * **Thursday**, hands down
   * Data for average delta of opening vs previous trading day close:
      * Mon: +0.056016
      * Tues: +0.228716
      * Wed: +0.114864
      * Thurs: -0.05267
      * Fri: +0.071502
* **Does the day of the week matter over a long period of time?**
   * Basically **no** \-- but if you're going to pick a day for auto-investing and want to feel like you're getting a 'deal' by buying on dips then you should pick Thurs morning
   * I setup my spreadsheet to show the total gains of auto-investing $100/week on a given day. I did not factor in closed trading days + that M1 Finance auto-invest on the next open trading day.  So certain days (Mondays particularly) had significantly less buys than Tues/Wed.
   * Data for average portfolio size of auto-investing in VTI:
      * Mon: 236 buys, cost-basis $23.6k, current value $35.7k, gain 51.22%
      * Tues: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $38.9k, gain 51.33%
      * Wed: 257 buys, cost-basis $25.7k, current value $39.0k, gain 51.96%
      * Thurs: 255 buys, cost-basis $25.5k, current value $38.7k, gain 51.93%
      * Fri: 253 buys, cost-basis $25.3k, current value $38.4k, gain +51.83%
* **What day of the week saw best overall gains?**
   * Still **Tuesdays**
   * Data for average delta of closing vs previous trading day close:
      * Mon: +0.076398
      * Tues: +0.160039
      * Wed: +0.13786
      * Thurs: +0.00851
      * Fri: +0.061344
   * If you compare this data vs the data from bullet #1, we see a few interesting facts:
      * Mon, Wed, and Thurs will close higher than opening
      * Tues and Fri we see some profit taking and close slightly lower than opening
* **What would happen if you just invested the $25.7k from bullet #2 in lump sum at the beginning of the 5 year period?**
   * Value of your VTI portfolio would be about **$60.5k** right now (or about 55% more vs weekly investing)
* **Lastly... What would happen if you invested in yearly lump sums at the 'worst possible day of the year' (simulating the most unlucky investor ever)?**
   * I divided the $25.7k into 5 parts and invested $5140 on the worst day of 2016, 17, 18, 19 and 20. The choices of 'worst day' was completely subjective based on eye balling charts when VTI would dip over subsequent days/weeks.
   * Dates chosen:
      * 2016 - June 8
      * 2017 - March 1
      * 2018 - Sept 20
      * 2019 - May 3
      * 2020 - Feb 10
   * Final account value was **$38.6k**, or roughly the same as weekly auto-investing $100.

The reason for this post is to just create a discussion on your market outlook and how you’re preparing for such outlook. I came across some data that inspired this post which states that of the 81% of companies to  have reported earnings this quarter, they by average beaten estimates by 15.2% higher. This has made the forward P/E about 22.1. Although still highly valued definitely not as high as other previous data. So I believe that maybe the market rally we saw coming last year into this one was about higher earnings despite COVID, and with that theory realized we might see either a sideways push or a correction in the near future. I am just preparing for this by keeping 10% of my account in cash to snatch some stocks in case of a pullback, and of course 90% I will remain invested because despite my own outlook the market may continue its rally higher due to lower rates and dovish fed stance.

The announcement last week that Bezos is going to step down and focus on the Bezos Earth Fund got me motivated about environmental/positive stocks that I can invest in. Now for a bit of background I am a Brazilian carnivore that loves a rodizio (look it up if you've never heard of it) but over the past few years I have tried to slowly reduce my carbon footprint by lowering the amount of meat I eat to only 3-4 days a week with the rest of the week having meat alternatives. This is mainly driven by my partner who is a vegetarian thanks to the countless documentaries showing the horrendous conditions animals are kept in (yes America, I am looking at you) and the carbon footprint impact it has on our planet (David Attenborough documentary **One Planet** if you want to see a LEGENDS take on it). At the end of 2020 I bought some shares in **Beyond Meat** which was both a financial and environmental decision based on the expected increase in demand due to people doing Veganuary. On the 6th of Jan it was downgraded to Overweight by Piper Sandler causing it to crash 9% in a day. I find this very convenient seeing as only 6 days later the stock almost doubled in price following the Taco Bell partnership news. Now the sceptic in me feels that was placed news in order to buy at a lower price following a tip off about the deal. I will never really know due to the rigged game we are playing but that is how I feel (note this is only my opinion and not targeting Piper here but someone in the know surely made a fortune on this pump down and up).

Now comes my question. I just feel like a lot of the best companies that are up and coming are only available to VCs and private investors (Lewis Hamilton, Di Caprio to name a couple) which leaves us behind on getting in. So what stocks do you guys think has both financial and environmental potential over the next few years? From my side a couple of companies I would love to invest in are **Impossible Foods** and **Moving Mountains** but neither of them are available to invest in by us retail investors (they are available to buy though so if you get a chance to try them out). Another company I invested in that is doing the part for the environment is **Brewdog PLC** who I believe has bucked the trend by not trying to cash out by selling to the Big Guys, as is usually the fate of most brewers around the world. They did this by creating **EquityForPunks** which allows us beer drinkers to own a share of the company (I'd share a referral link but don't want this to be advertising in any way) . They have managed to raise over £100M through this and part of their latest fund raising was to become **carbon negative** for the entire life of the company (look up **Brewdog for Tomorrow)**. That is right guys they looked back at their total footprint and have now managed to become one of the first companies who is carbon negative (I don't know who but I'm sure others came first) by a range of actions including buying 2,000+ acres of land to plan trees. This is something I can really support and hopefully make some money later down the line when they decide to go public (or at least not lose money hopefully). If you have anything to share that you think is worth keeping an eye on please share :)

“We are excited to see the market for gaming and streaming product continue to grow at such a pace.  It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time.  Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future.  I am particularly pleased that the revenue from our gaming components and systems segment is now over $1 billion.  And equally happy to see our gamer and creator peripherals segment grow by 83% and break through the half billion milestone.  Obviously this is amazing growth in both segments.  We continue to bring out exciting new product in all our product lines, and these seem to be resonating well with our current and new customers.  In fact our last three major product launches, the K100 keyboard, the Elgato Wave microphone, and the 4000X gaming case, are all showing near 5 star reviews at major retailers, and gained solid market share in a short time,” stated Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of Corsair.

We have paid off an additional $50 million in debt during the quarter, making the total debt repayment $190 million for 2020.  We expect to continue to use our operating cashflows to reduce our debt and continue to invest in growth.  We also had a successful secondary offering this January, with all net proceeds going to the selling shareholders participating in the secondary,” said Michael G. Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair.

Financial Outlook

For the full year 2021, we currently expect:

Net revenue to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion.
Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million.
Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million.
Certain non-GAAP measures included in our financial outlook were not reconciled to the comparable GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. We are unable to reconcile these forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts because we are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures for these periods but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Such items may include stock-based compensation charges, public offering related charges, depreciation and amortization, severance, IPO costs and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our GAAP financial results.

The foregoing forward-looking statements reflect our expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. We do not intend to update our financial outlook until our next quarterly results announcement.

Please see “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a discussion on how we calculate the non-GAAP measures presented herein and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Looking for suggestions but am leaning towards selling puts.

My thought is to sell July 2021 puts on AVGO, MSFT, AAPL, TSM. Setting strikes for 25-35% discounts on these stocks would get you a rough return of 3-4% annualized. Nothing spectacular but beats money markets. In the event the market crashes before July, I would be happy to buy any of these stocks at the discount.

Let me know if you have better suggestions for names to sell puts on (without excessive risk) or other strategies to generate yield.

My broker is offering to (potentially) allocate me some shares at the IPO price. I'm probably going to pass on it, but want to make sure there isn't universal agreement that I'd be foolish to do that.

Normally, in the current market environment, I'd jump on any IPO they offer me. But I really question Bumble's sexist business model - just rubs me the wrong way. But as an old guy whose been married for 20 years, I'm not really in their target market.

So how to people in the target really feel about Bumble? I feel like Tinder, Match and Plenty of Fish are the preferred dating apps for most 20-somethings. Bumble seems like something that people go to once they get sick of the other ones as a last-ditch effort before abandoning online dating all together. Women go there once they're jaded and sick of receiving random dick picks; men go there once they're desperate and haven't gotten matches anywhere else (which seems like a self-defeating process since men have no control on Bumble).

I'm also not impressed by the ""friend finder"" and ""Linked-In alternative"" strategies. I feel like Linked in already fills that role and it's going to be tough to compete with the established platform. And I don't think that the population of people looking to make online friends for hanging out is a big population.

My personal negative view of the company makes me think it's not going to be successful long-term, and that it is unlikely to even have a first-day bump from the IPO price. If they price it at $40, I'd be surprised if it moves up from that much at all.

Debate between Husband and Wife on Investment strategy and philosophy.

**Let me explain this hypothetical scenario to you...**

You work in international business and times have been tough prior to right now. You just now land a deal that will put $2,000,000 in your pocket today, with that same amount recurring for the next 12 months. Your lifestyle is relatively simple and with that first payment, half of that will secure everything for your family including; house, cars, food, clothing, bills etc. for many years. The remaining 12 month payments will likely end up in other investments such as real estate or physical gold or silver, or perhaps as an investor in new businesses.

Prior to today and this deal, you have been studying the stock market heavily and enjoy the analysis and seeing how accurate you can be and was already thinking about spending most of your time on day trading for your basic income.

Now, both you and your wife fully agree on taking $1,000,000 from that first payment as money that can be lost in or used to make money in the stock market.

**How do you build your stock portfolio? Are you aggressive? How aggressive? Define that.**

Here are the points of view currently being debated.

**Husband - Very aggressive**

He says use all $1,000,000 on 1 or 2 individual stocks for very short term daily trades, focusing purely on the technical analysis on relatively volatile stocks, buy in the dip and sell on an upswing for a few percent quick gain. Repeat daily, never chasing large gains or long term gains.

**Wife - Slightly Aggressive**

She says what all financial advisors have always said (both husband and wife have done this professionally) and to diversify but to look at fundamentals along with technical analysis and make plays that will result in a couple percentage point gains per stock and may result in that over a short period of time such as days or weeks.

What would you do in this scenario? Would you agree with Husband or Wife? Or something completely different?"|investing|Debate between Husband and Wife on Investment strategy and philosophy.|0.0|0.47
1612916881.0|0.0|t3_lghmvv|19.0|"Hello,

Here's a portfolio for those with the willingness to take on risk for maximum returns (especially young savers).

**Explanation**

1) Choose a globally-diversified, low-expense set of smart-beta stock ETFs (tilting to factors that outperform like value, quality and momentum).

2) Use margin to leverage the portfolio to \~2:1, which is the optimal investment size for maximum returns as per the Kelly Criterion.

3) Sell short [SPX box spreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) in order to borrow near the risk-free rate (\~0.5%).

The portfolio is much more tax-efficient than using derivatives (since most gains stay unrealized). Historically (using US data back to 1929), the above portfolio would've indeed significantly outperformed the market. I don't care for past performance but it is always nice to confirm that the intuition indeed played out empirically.

**Positions**

I like a 50/30/20 split of US/Ex-US/EM (especially since International has attractive valuations). For the US, I like VFMF, VIOV and some VTI. For Ex-US, I like FNDF, ISCF, FNDE and EMGF.

**Brokerage**

Definitely Interactive Brokers. Their rock-bottom margin rates are vital. You can lower the rate further by selling [SPX boxes short](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/).

**Rebalance**

As the market goes up, this strategy calls for you to buy more stocks to get the leverage back up to 2:1. You also need to sell stocks during market declines to keep maintain close to 2:1 leverage. This might seem ""buy high, sell low"" but there's no reliable way to time or mis-time the market so don't worry about that. Rebalancing is key to make sure you don't blow up and that you maintain a high CAGR long-term. I recommend rebalancing if leverage is outside 1.8-2.2x, or once a month. Don't rebalance too frequently (say, daily, like those leveraged ETFs), it's not optimal.

**Conclusion**

Leverage is taboo but if used properly, without overbetting, using well-diversified funds, it can be a useful portfolio for those looking to take on more risk for more reward (like myself)."|investing|Consider A Globally-Diversified Leveraged Portfolio|19.0|0.86

GM: This is a very long term plan but with the vision of trying to turn every car model into a EV model they will help tremendously with the whole EV revolution. The traditionally American SUV or Truck will be provided by GM car's not Tesla as we saw with the cybertruck 

WKHS: They have partnerships and probably will have more with other companies and providing them with EV vehicles and overall a really good long term investment I believe so

I am particularly interested in diversifying into the clean energy sector.  The fact that I have not seen anything pointing towards the optimum method of generating clean / renewable energy at this point in time makes me want to focus less on the energy generation method itself, but something more diversified, common, and required between all forms of energy as a whole: **the storage of energy.**

Are there any solid energy storage ETFs that you could suggest I look into?  I would prefer US company-centric ETFs if possible.

Note: I am relatively new to this sector, so I won't claim to be an expert.  If I am not considering something in my assumptions, please feel free to share your insights and let me know.  Specifically, if I am off the mark regarding the energy generation methods (wind, solar, etc.) let me know.

I considered some companies out there to be overvalued last year, but they've doubled, tripled, or even grew ten-fold in value in the past year. Why are they trading at 100x their top line?! Some companies are burning money like never before, have a smaller revenue than before, and are firing people left and right, but they still grew 700%. wtf. Take SPWR as an example, or LMND. I walk past the LMND offices every day, I met Shai Wininger in person. I'm not going to rant about that specific company, but the market is disconnected from reality. LMND has 80M in revenue, burns money, doesn't grow, but tripled in value in 6 months. Why??

1612900006.0|0.0|t3_lgbo46|29.0|"Open to feedback and counter arguments. 

**Starting Point**

- Researchers are warning that COVID19 will accelerate the global growth of patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) over a long period of time. That’s because the disease damages the kidney’s much in the same way it damages the lungs. The exact number of patients who will develop CKD after contracting COVID is unknown but could be as high as 8% of total patients (combining 25% of AKI occurrences in [NIH study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7598516/) with 35% prevalence of [Mt. Sinai study](https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2020/mount-sinai-researchers-warn-increase-in-chronic-kidney-disease-linked-to-covid19-pr)).  Regardless of the exact figures, even when considering increased mortality of COVID for patients with preexisting CKD, let’s move forward with the premise that COVID will increase the growth of CKD patients globally.

**TAM**

- According to [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/dialysis-market-102367), “The global dialysis market size was $90.33 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach USD 177.56 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period.”

- A quick google search will produce many equivalent sources. You’ll also see that COVID-aside the TAM for CKD was already projected to grow at astonishing rates globally due to increased prevalence of diabetes resulting in part from the spread unhealthy western diets and an increased sedentary lifestyle. But for the purposes of this post, let’s use the forecast from FBI above.

**The Investment**
- Fresenius Medical Care [FMS] - This German-based company is one of the world’s leading providers of products and services for people with kidney failure.

**The Catalyst**
- Overreaction to a recent news release introduces opportunity for value play: 
- On February 01, FMS issued a [press release](https://www.freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/news/preliminary-announcement-2021targets/) stating that, “accelerated COVID-19 related excess mortality of dialysis patients and continued related higher direct costs [will] negatively affect 2021 business development.” More specifically, “Based on the currently available information and status of analysis, revenue growth of up to mid-single digits and assumes net income before potential restructuring measures to decline by up to 25 percent.”
 
- In summary, they are being hit hard in the short term by COVID. CKD patients are dying at much higher rates than the baseline, and they have significantly higher operating costs due to precautionary measures. However, these are temporary setbacks. Remember, the research suggests that COVID will **increase** the number of CKD patients over time **even when considering the increased mortality rate.** FMS concludes, “Fresenius Medical Care’s mid-term targets until 2025 as defined in October 2020, remain unchanged.”
 
- The share price dropped from roughly $42 to about $34 or approximately 20%. I argue that the market is overreacting to the short-term impact of COVID on FMS and thus presenting a long term opportunity.
 
**Basic Financial Picture**
 
- First, a review of their financial situation suggests steady and stable growth across the past several years. Nothing really grabs my attention. They have health cash flow. Manageable debt. Revenue growth. Stable margins. I’ll paste some of the basic numbers below and then dive into my projections.
 
FMS basic financial numbers (in millions) 
 
In millions | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- 
Revenue | 19573 | 19541 | 20100 | 17910 | 16737
Net Income | 1343 | 2340 | 1446 | 1243 | 1029
EPS | 2.22 | 3.81 | 2.35 | 2.03 | 1.69
Cash on Hand | 1128 | 2533 | 1105 | 747 | 549
Total Assets | 36886 | 30992 | 27155 | 26933 | 25365
Total Liabilities | 22072 | 15754 | 14916 | 15476 | 14869
Net Cash Flow | -1274 | 1378 | 304 | 197 | -84
Free Cash Flow per Share | 0.65 | -0.45 | 0.64 | 0.16 | 0.13
Debt/Equity Ratio | 0.68 | 0.58 | 0.68 | 0.74 | 0.82
Net Profit Margin | 6.86 | 11.98 | 7.2 | 6.94 | 6.15
Return on Investment | 7.31 | 12.4 | 9.35 | 8.3 | 7.16
 
**My Napkin Math**
- Let’s calculate global market share that FMS captured for treatment of CKD patients in 2019. (17.48B EURO X 1.12 USD) / 90.33 TAM) = 21.6%.
- Net income 2019 was $1.34B
- Assuming market share is stable, projected to 2027, 21.6% of the $177.56 billion TAM is $38.35 billion revenue.
- Median net profit margin going back through 2018 – 7.5%
- Applying this median net profit margin to the 2027 revenue estimate gives us a net income 2027 estimate of $2.88B. Which means you could conservatively say that FMS net income will double by 2027.
- Current price is 34.21 with P/E ratio of 12.59
- Median P/E ratio over the past 10 years is 17.6.
- Let’s assume current P/E ratio is maintained. That puts 2027 price target at $73.52.
- Let’s assume return to median P/E ratio of 17.6. That puts 2027 price target at $102.77
- Let’s assume high P/E ratio of 23.96 that occurred in 2016. That puts 2027 price target at $139.90
- **That’s a potential 114% - 308% gain over 6 years** on share price alone. Pretty good considering FMS really only needs to scale their current operations enough to maintain their market share and margin. That’s a fairly low bar for a company that is at the top of the field and growing. And to put icing on the cake, they have a growing dividend which current sits at a ~2% yield.

**Headwinds**
- While researchers think COVID19 will increase the number of CKD patients over a long period of time, it’s also apparent that patients with pre-existing kidney disorders have a higher COVID19 mortality rate than their peers without kidney disease. That means that demand might suffer in the short-term for companies who are currently providing dialysis services. Furthermore, as with many businesses, there are increased COVID19-related costs for kidney care providers – especially those who specialize in outpatient kidney care clinics as opposed to at home services as they need to take extra precaution with PPE and immune compromised patients.
- The largest headwind in my opinion is the movement from dialysis clinics to home dialysis. FMS primarily providers in clinic dialysis services and our model falls apart if FMS loses market share. However, FMS is well aware of the transformation to home dialysis, as this is not a new development, and they are shifting their business model to provide more of these services. Moreover, the initiative to move to home dialysis, while aggressive, has been ongoing since the Obama years and FMS revenue has not seen a dramatic hit. Still, to decrease this risk, I’m hedging against FMS’s failure to adapt by also going long on OM, a young company that produces the best home dialysis machines on the market.  
 
**Other companies**
- Onset Medical [OM] – Mentioned above. Disruptive tech. New company. Sky high valuation but useful as a hedge against FMS losing market share.
- Davita Kidney Care [DVA] – FMS’s largest US competitor. I consider them a strong long-term investment as well, as they are moving to home dialysis model faster and they have a slightly better reputation than FMS in terms of quality, but their valuation is much higher at the moment."|investing|FMS - undervalued COVID play on kidney care dialysis company|29.0|0.85

Does this tell us that Tesla is actually made more money from selling stock issuance/right-share rather than operating profit?

Why, if I could sell all my shares right now for a small profit, are these sections showing up in the negative?

As a further question; I am receiving a notification saying this -

""Margin cushion: 2.78% remaining""

What does this mean? Again, I am relatively inexperienced, so apologies if this is all simple stuff. Thanks in advance to any of you who can shed some light on this for me.

Edit: I think I may have worked it out. I forgot to mention, I sold shares yesterday for $533, which comes to roughly £390.

I don't think so.

As someone said better than I last week TL;DR... Corsair has already teased their full 2020 earnings in a prospectus a couple of weeks ago on 1/21. We already know they're ending with an incredible year. Better yet, the institutional traders have their heads in the sand on it. [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33)

Since that announcement, the stock has increased **27%**. Earnings surprise must be priced in right? I doubt it

Looking at LOGI, the closest competitor. We saw a big dip starting 1/15 (day before earnings announcement), and on 1/18, day of ER). Standard 2021 post-earnings IV crush.... Right before it ran to ATH 2 weeks later.

Now looking at CRSR vs Logi movements [https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB](https://imgur.com/Bf1gVZB) CRSR had a big drop around the same time too. But why? They didnt' release earnings. No major news. No IV crush?

**On 1/13/21, Corsair dropped from the sky, on the same day $G M E started its short squeeze and jumped 57% in a day.**

Maybe a coincidence. Or maybe the 1/13 squeeze wasn't a price correction, it was direct a reaction to the squeeze and overall market pullback. Hedge funds moving money around.

 Oh yea, guess who owns 2% of the outstanding float of CRSR? The kings of Squeeze themselves, Citadel [https://imgur.com/xlQNZy](https://imgur.com/xlQNZyJ) 

Then price began to recover to normal, until 1/27 and they announced a secondary PO.... price drops again.

And THEN we run to $46-$47...27% gain from the post-drop low of $36.

**BUT, we are only 7% up from the recent high trading averages of $41, and still 9% below the ATH.**

This doesn't sound like its overpriced at all. Sounds like the recent high IVs are result of the price normalization, not over-buying.

**TL;DR:** I think the IV crush or post-earnings selloff is going to be mild, and a precursor to a very fast bounce-back bull run to ATHs"|investing|Here's why I think $CRSR does not already have the earnings surprise priced in|70.0|0.83

It's been well documented on here that their ~~preorders~~ *non-binding contracts* are exceeding 100k, they have relationships with LG, GM, Workhorse, and Camping World, and are still targeting a September release to be the first to market EV truck. They are working on 57 prototypes now for beta that are scheduled to be completed in March, so as of now seem to be on schedule.

Lordstown has over a 4.5b market cap as a company with $0 in revenue, which is both incredible and incredibly expensive, but the upside potential is certainly there for a high risk opportunity.

First, trying to determine the value of an EV company in 2021 is difficult. Using a revenue run rate multiple is the simplest to get an approximation of potential value. 

**Tesla**

- 2021 Revenue *high estimate* **56.47b**

- Current Market Cap **818.43b**

- Revenue Multiple **14.49**



**Nio**

- 2021 Revenue *high estimate* **5.79b**

- Current Market Cap **92.09b**

- Revenue Multiple **15.91**

For Lordstown, we have to make assumptions. Lordstown's initial production projections are as follows:

- 2021 - 2k (reaffirmed by the CEO in a 2/6 interview)

- 2022 - 32k

- 2023 - 65k

Assuming 32000 trucks is obtainable, all trucks are sold at base level ($52500), and there are no other revenue sources (so excluding potential service revenue and Workhorse revenue for simplicity), this brings revenue to 1.68b in 2022. If we give Lordstown a similar 14x revenue run rate multiple, that brings the market cap to approximately 23.5b q1 2022. That's an upside potential of approximately **5x its current valuation.**

Of course this is all dependent on actually producing real units on the timeframe outlined, which is why it is certainly a high-risk investment. 

A couple other notes:
Lordstown is in the final stages of possibly receiving a government loan that CEO Steve Burns said was unnecessary to hit their estimates, but would be able to speed up their production schedule. It will be interesting to see if there is any more information on this when they report earnings this month.

2 of their first prototypes caught fire. The most recent apparently had a battery problem. I'm definitely interested to see if they release any sort of statement regarding it."|investing|Lordstown Motors Potential Growth|10.0|0.78

I always wondered how often should I invest my paychecks - if I invested every time I got them I would pay a lot of brokerage, but if I put them in a savings account and waited too long for them too accumulate, I would miss out on returns.

I realised yesterday that I could actually calculate an optimal frequency if the following conditions hold:

* You have a set amount from each paycheck that you'd invest
* You have a passive porfolio (ETFs that track the market with pretty predictable returns)
* You plan to invest over a relatively long period

I essentially optimised the present value of the investments into perpetuity (discounting at the portfolio rate of return). Here is a write-up I made explaining it: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wn2poe83f1zgokd/returns.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wn2poe83f1zgokd/returns.pdf?dl=0)

The earnings released on January 26th show MSFT beat earnings and revenue expectations for the eighth straight quarter as reported on the last earnings report about two weeks ago. Earnings of $2.03 per share easily topped expectations by 39 cents, while revenue of $43.08 billion grew almost 17% year over year and beat estimates by more than $2.8 billion.

Since the release of this earnings report, the stock value has been uncharacteristically quiet and only hovering around the $242 range.

This made me investigate what’s going on and I discovered over 12 Microsoft executives acquired common stocks as recently reported on February 1st with the SEC Form 4 filings. I calculated 1,348,758 common stock shares that were acquired by Microsoft leadership in the last month.

This potentially means MSFT will be releasing some big news in the near future. Potentially even as early as the next couple of weeks and I believe it will be either an M&amp;A, a new technology product, or a large government contract to make all these executives acquire common stocks at the all-time high price.

I picked up 500 call options as I’m conservatively estimating their stocks might increase over $250 in the next two weeks.

Another thing to note is ARK Investment Management LLC reported a 30.67% increase in their ownership of MSFT / Microsoft Corp about three months ago. ARK does a lot better investigating potential disruptive technologies so they might have been previewed to some knowledge that helped them decide to increase their position that much.

This is not financial advice and just my opinions. Please do your own DD before making any financial investments. Also please share your thoughts and insights on this as I am also thinking about buying some long-term shares tomorrow depending on what others mention or discovered.

Currently I'm trading in a personal investing account with TD, but capital gains tax is seriously impeding the growth of my account, especially because most of my trades are short term.

So I've been looking for a structure that will let me trade with little or none capital gains tax, and instead tax distributions.

The most similar thing I can think of is an IRA, where there is no capital gains tax but distributions are taxed as income when you take them. Unfortunately, unlike an IRA, I want to be able to take distributions at any time without penalty, only tax (instead of 59.5 yrs old) and I also want to be able to contribute any amount. 

There are also similarities to a hedge fund, but setting up a hedge fund is overkill because I'm not looking to raise outside capital or handle money that isn't my own.

Besides a hedge fund, I've looked at private equity and family offices but none fit the bill. Maybe I've overlooked something but I've hit a dead end and unfortunately, I don't know what I don't know, so I'm not even sure what I've missed.

1. Should I invest my money in ETFs or individual stocks? Obviously the likes of SPY and QQQ are really safe long term bets, but over the past couple years especially, tech is outgrowing those ETFs by a non-trivial amount. So I was thinking about putting some money in ETFs, some money in tech stocks, and some money in sectors that I believe will grow in 2020's (electric car, renewable energy, etc). Is this a viable breakdown? If so, about what percentage of my portfolio each of those three ""categories"" should be?
2. I work at a tech company and I get RSUs. Should I keep my company RSU and hold for over a year so that it becomes long term capital gains or should I immediately sell and proceed with whatever strategy is the answer for question 1?
3. Should I invest in high-dividend ETFs and companies? I do want to eventually retire and live on dividends, but aren't dividends taxed higher and contribute to a slower stock growth? As someone who's starting at ground zero, what's a good percentage breakdown between high dividend and high growth stocks?

There are some obvious benefits of rolling out vaccine in pill forms (i.e. can be stored in room temperature, ease of transportation, cheaper cost to produce). Unlike Pfizer's vaccine that has to be store at negative 70 degree Celsius, Vaxart's vaccine has some clear distribution advantages especially in third world countries.

Last week the company announced its Phase 1 trial results and absolutely blundered their PR, which sent the stock down like 60%.

* sibling is married to someone who would bleed their savings dry if it existed

I initially considered investing with a trust account because it would absolve me of the tax burden when rebalancing the portfolio. I’m just worried that she may fall onto hard times before my death in which case I’d like to present her with some of the cash by liquidating as needed.

I’ve also contemplated letting her sign up for the account that I would fund and set up automatic investments through m1. My only issue is there’s no way to stop her (or her SO) from liquidating when ever they want to go fishing or buy a 36 pack. It also leaves my bank account wide open to them. Even if she were to hide it from him, they’d receive tax documents once a year for it.

My other option is to just open a secondary account and treat the investments as my own, eat the tax, and do what I want with the money when I want. Including not giving them a dime if they somehow turn their life style around.

I have never been exposed to the markets until quarantine of last November. I had taken economics back in high school and paper traded, but I had never taken it seriously until now. Now, I see the power of investing and want to tackle the market with a larger capital with the goal of gaining 1% daily. From what I've heard, growing 1% daily is not as easy as it seems, but I feel that with the recent consistent growth of the market, now is a better time than any other. With my 35K, I will work to grow it into a six figure account in one year.

Good Evening Folks,

ZOM had some great numbers today, reaching 2.91 during the day trading. the after hours press release regarding the sale of about $25.0 Million Bought Deal Offering of Common Shares to Wainwright &amp; Co., LLC under which the underwriter has agreed to purchase on a firm commitment basis 13,157,895 common shares of Zomedica, at a price to the public of $1.90 per share appeaered to stir a brief panic and share price dropped in the after hours to about the 2.25 range before rebounding. AT the time I write this is as recouped most of its loss and is holding its own at about 2.53/share in the after hours market.

[Zomedica Corp. Announces $25.0 Million Bought Deal Offering of Common Shares - World News Report - EIN Presswire (einnews.com)](https://world.einnews.com/pr_news/535344817/zomedica-corp-announces-25-0-million-bought-deal-offering-of-common-shares)

I've posted several times about ZOM and my feelings that this stock will go after its March 31 debut of its Truforma veterinary diagnostic system (see below)

Some appear worried that this share purchase will dilute the market. I on the other hand see this 25.0 million stock buy as a positive reinforcement that ZOM will indeed pan out long term. Again, this is a long term hold opportunity not a short term thing. At last check I think they were only shorted like 10% or so so definitely not a short squeeze opportunity from where I stand.

A couple other stocks I will be pushing up share numbers on this week include Genworth Financials (GNW) who has dug themselves out of debt despite the delayed merger with a debt to equity ratio of .23 and beat analyst estimates for 3rg qtr by about .16 per share. This is NOT a rocket stock by any means..a slow grower...but I firmly believe it will continue to see a marked increase after its 4th qtr earnings statement slated for February 17.

Genius Brands: Despite some bad press pointing to their stock dilution in 2020 and their ""burning through cash"" as it prepares for its ramp up of Kartoon Channel line up the stock continues to grow why? I firmly believe their debut this spring of Stan Lee's Super Hero's Kindergarten will take off (hello??? STAN LEE..and ARNOLD) along with their recent acquisition of Chizcomm may give them the extra marketing tools they need to make this enterprise work.

Again, no risk no gain here but their recent collaboration with Exelixis (EXEL) to Develop Novel Masked Antibody-Drug Conjugate Therapies with Improved Safety and Efficacy Profiles on February 1 may be enough to pop the stock.

This isn't an argument that mutual funds are better than ETFs, just some of the differences. ETFs are great too.

1.  Easier automatic investing through certain brokerages. 
2.  Behavioral advantages (for some): impulses to get in and out of the market are easier to overcome because the fund only trades once per day. You have until 4pm to modify any existing orders. Whatever order is inputted at 4pm on a given day is what happens. It's not as if you freak out at market open you can sell everything. 
3.  Fits nicer and more cleanly into a fund that has other mutual funds in it (like VTSAX). You see your daily returns *all at once* when the mutual funds settle for the price, as opposed to seeing the ETF changes by themselves during the day and then the total average at night. This again helps with behavior. If the S&amp;P is up 1% on a given day but the Nasdaq is up .25% you see the gains averaged out and it gives your more perspective on what is actually happening. Not a huge deal, but it something. 

Anyways, it turns out that it's really difficult to invest in the Nasdaq Composite or Nasdaq 100 via a mutual fund. That is, *unless I'm missing something*. Here are the options: 

1. FNCMX (Fidelity) - Only for Fidelity users
1. USNQX - seems like the best one. But 0.48% Fee and $50 transaction fee through a lot of brokers
1. OTPIX - Fee is 1.56% which is ridiculous 
1. NASDX - Fee is 0.70% pretty steep 
1. RYHOX- Fee is 1.63% which is ridiculous 

If we compare USNQX (the best option, I think) with QQQ unfortuately the .48% destroys a lot of your gains over the long run. It cuts down on 50% of the gains on your original investment if held for 20 years. Evidence (expand the time scale at the bottom to 20 years): https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?USNQX%2C%20qqq

Is this the state of things? Are there really this few options for passive nasdaq funds that aren't ETFs? I'm surprised by this. There are thousands of S&amp;P mutual funds with under 0.5% fee. But for the nasdaq (i.e., if you want less exposure to banks and more to technology) the opportunities aren't great for mutual fund fans. 

Am I missing anything here? I imagine I am? Anyone in a similar position? How do you deal with it? Hopefully this post can help people with a similar question now or in the future.

**LivePerson (NASDAQ: LPSN)**

Making life easier for consumers and brands across the globe through intelligent conversation AI.

**Company Overview**

LivePerson (“LPSN”) is an American online messaging and solutions company established in 1995 and headquartered in New York City.

Beginning with the invention of live chat on consumer websites in 1995 by founder and CEO Robert LoCascio, LivePerson changed the way that consumers connect with their favorite online brands. In 2018 LivePerson laid out their new vision for AI-powered conversations that will pave the way for brands to provide quick and excellent customer experiences. 

LPSN IPO’d at around $8 in April 2000 and had seen a disappointing return in share price until investors started to catch on in early 2017. Today, LPSN is trading at an all-time high $70 and sporting a $4.52 billion market cap.

In 2020, LivePerson was named to Fast Companies annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies. An award that honors businesses making the most profound impacts on both industry and culture in today’s very fast changing business landscape. As of 2020 LivePerson technology has powered over 1 billion brand-to-consumer conversations to over 18,000 customers.

*Conversational AI*

To get a better sense of how their conversation AI functions click the link below:

[LivePerson Conversational AI: Introduction - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMhjEYTqAU)

**Business Fundamentals**

**Company Financials**

In their most recent Q3’20 earnings, LivePerson recorded a revenue increase of 26% year over year (“y/y”) from Q3’19 with $94.8 million in revenue. As a result, the company raised its revenue guidance for full year 2020 to a range of $362.5 million to $364.5 million (up from $357.0 million to $361.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA was $15.1 million and generated a multi-year high profit margin of 16%. As they approach their Q4’20 earnings, LPSN entered the quarter with strong momentum given increased platform conversation volumes, record contract signings, and a revenue rate well beyond previous estimates. Additionally, the company raised 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $29.0 million to $31.0 million, up from prior guidance of $16 million to $19.0 million.

**Revenue streams and products**

LivePerson operates as a SAS model to medium and large size commercial businesses including the likes of Home Depot, Virgin Atlantic, Delta Airlines, IBM, HSBC, and T-Mobile.

LPSN uses an open platform model that allows their technology to be implemented with user-friendly messaging apps including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SMS, WeChat and more. As more businesses continue to transition their interactions to messaging, this will help grow and improve the machine learning of their conversational AI that will unlock new customer insights and potential use cases for brands.

*Intent Manager* uses LPSN’s NLU engine to identify the intents of customer inquiries to operate and inform critical business decisions.

*Conversation Builder* uses a point-and-click interface that limits the options for customers but makes it easy to build bots that can automate these interactions.

*Conversation Manager* allows enterprises to organize and manage all customer interactions by consolidating everything into a single view. This also includes an agent assist that will suggest to the best content or bot to handle customer intent. These recommendations are presented directly in the conversation flow to expedite responses.

**Industry and competitive landscape**

**Total addressable market**

LivePerson estimates the current total addressable market to be $60 billion, however this is likely to continue growing higher as many opportunities are largely unrealized.

Existing vertical opportunities include Financial services, consumer retail, utilities, telecommunications, travel and hospitality, media, technology, real estate, and education.

Their new vertical opportunities for 2020 and beyond include but are not limited to healthcare, government, non-profits, manufacturing, wholesale, and professional services.

It really is difficult to think of a consumer facing industry that will not require some sort of conversational AI in order to maximize cost and efficiency, especially as more businesses make the switch to digital commerce. A Forrestor study that was commissioned by LivePerson found that only a third of business enterprises believe they can react to consumer needs in real-time.

**Growth strategy**

The leadership team at LivePerson is very focused on an organic growth strategy and increasing their operating leverage. The CEO LaCascio went as far to say that “There will be a trillion dollar company in this space (conversation AI) and I want it to be us.” Through heavy investments in their AI technology and algorithms, LPSN is creating leverage over their competitors to create and implement a superior product. In 2018, Alex Spinelli joined LPSN as the Chief Technology Officer after previously serving as head of the Alexa OS for Amazon. With him he recruited over 200 AI developers set on creating and improving a comprehensive roadmap for all their AI services.

The total addressable market for LivePerson is not limited to any one industry but recently they have capitalized on the digitalization of our economy as a result of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Historically, LPSN has targeted their business towards large call centers for banks or telecommunication customers as part of their strategy but the pandemic has created new opportunities for them. Back in May of 2020 the CEO made his stance clear that the pandemic has ushered in the “Death of the call center”. In March 2020, the volume of LivePerson’s chat feature 10x’d with their existing customers. Especially during the height of the pandemic most people in America can relate to the idea of being put on hold by their bank, utility service, healthcare provider, etc. LPSN can implement their conversational AI technology into these sectors to create quick and effective customer solutions. Besides, who doesn’t like texting more than calling someone.

In the retail sector, LPSN has been closing deals with new and existing customers in the retail sector to provide curbside pick-up through their AI messaging. Additionally, they have developed technology that allows you to scan a QR code on an in-store item using a smart-phone and have an AI-conversation about the products even after you have left the store.

**Awards and Recognition**

LivePerson was named to Fast Companies annual list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies.

LivePerson’s Maven conversational AI platform won “Best AI-based Solution for Customer Service.” from AI Breakthrough, which recognizes top companies, technologies, and products in the global artificial intelligence market.

LSP received Frost &amp; Sullivan’s Customer Value Leadership Award for conversational AI in financial services.

**Conclusion**

The stock is currently trading at an all-time high but this is a potential long-term investment that should reward it’s investors as the inevitable implementation of AI becomes more prevalent in our society. The technology is not perfect by any means but it will continually get better as more and more businesses implement their services. Looking into the future I would just ask myself what will be the future of customer interaction, call centers or bot technology?

While Psychedelics are still in their infancy in terms of legalization in Canada, few companies are starting to emerge onto the Stock Market that have the potential to grow exponentially and be recognized as potential big players in the emerging psychedelic market in Canada. One company in particular has been gaining traction, NeonMind BioSciences Inc, with a recent article portraying their goals on CTV News &amp; how they interestingly plan to tackle obesity, an epidemic which according to StatCan affects 26.8% of Canadians over the age of 18 (Most recent statistic dated 2018) &amp; 36.5% of Americans (according to healthline.com).

**Media Coverage:**

A recent article published by CTV News Vancouver details NeonMind, &amp; how they are conducting a preclinical trial using psylocibin to treat obesity at the University of British Columbia.

According to CTV News Vancouver, NeonMind is working with Dr. C. Laird Birmingham, a psychiatry professor at UBC, who’s main expertise includes eating disorders. CTV News interviewed Dr. Birmingham about the trails, to which he states:

“Most people lose weight, but they rarely maintain. Psilocybin has the potential to serve as a new and different tool to help people lose weight and maintain their weight loss by changing their neural pathways.""

The overall goal of the trails taking place at UBC is to examine whether psychedelics like psilocybin are capable of changing unconscious responses to emotional situations that can trigger addictions, including food-related addictions. Previous research from UBC has shown that controlled use of psylocibin can be successful in treating other mental disorders such as PTSD, and with the growing push to legalize medical mushrooms in Canada, now is the time to invest in a promising company like NeonMind.

**Strong Points:**

These milestones have already been achieved by the company (as claimed by their website):

* ""We have signed a restricted drug supply agreement with Psygen Labs Inc. for psilocybin supply through an agent for our preclinical trial, direct supply for our potential clinical trials, and for potential commercial launch of a drug product to aid weight loss.""
* ""On October 7, 2020, Health Canada granted approval to Dr. Alasdair Barr to possess psilocybin to carry out our preclinical trial, and the trial officially started in November 2020.""

**Future Milestones:**

According to their website, NeonMind states that:

* ""We expect to have enough information from our preclinical trial to apply for our planned Phase 2 Human Clinical Trial in the Spring of 2021.""
* ""We have filed 5 U.S. provisional patents to protect our intellectual property related to the administration of psychedelic substances to aid in weight loss, treat obesity and its complications, reduce food cravings, treat compulsive eating disorders and alter the diets of individuals.""

So, with a strong team behind them, positive clinical trials in Canada, future prospects of entering the U.S. market and a stock price of just 25 cents CAD a share (as of February 8, 2021) , now is definitely a smart time to buy into this company.

## Summary

ABNB is on the pricey side for what it is today - a booking company that will likely recover well from the pandemic - but it is underpriced for what the company should be - a major disruptor to all sectors related to travel and hospitality. With good growth rates today (&gt;30%) and a massive pool of potential total addressable market (TAM) to enter (flights, actual hotels, cars, long-term rentals, ancillary hospitality services) they should be able to build on this for years to come. 

I have a very long-term mindset here - invest for what they’re going to be in ten years, not two. I will probably wait until mid-June to buy in as insiders should start being able to trade around then and many of them will want to get some cash in exchange for their hard work in the years prior to IPO.

## My Vision

You want to take a vacation from the US to Paris for a week with your SO. You request the time off at work, and hop on your go-to service for going somewhere that you don’t live - ABNB. You book your flight on “Air BNB Airlines” - you get free checked bags, early seat choices, and a discount on the ticket price because you’re part of the ABNB membership program. You arrive at the airport in Paris and turn your phone back on - ABNB recognizes you’ve landed and schedules your rideshare to the cool apartment you’ve booked for the week. You collect your luggage and head to the car, once inside you decide that you’re feeling a little tired from the trip - you open the ABNB app and pre-order a bottle of red wine and a nice dinner - which is waiting for you when you’re dropped off. You eat dinner, open the app once more to book a bike tour of the city for the next day, and get a great night sleep after a hassle free day of travel.

## Markets &amp; Strategies

Key markets I think ABNB can and should expand into in addition to continuing to expand their core businesses with bookings and experiences.

**Flights &amp; Rail**

ABNB needs to get into flights, and likely into rail in certain markets (EU). The clearest way to enter is with their current “as a booking service” model. A bigger, bolder play would be to acquire or merge with a global airline. Airlines are struggling, but bundling it with a strong company with more diversified revenue streams is a much better play than trying to make the margins work on flights alone. Further, if the travel offering can be a part of an attractive, recurring revenue offering from ABNB it should not only allow the company to monetize well but to also return shareholder value at a higher rate (recurring revenues tend to have higher multiples).

**Rideshare**

A meaningful chunk of ridesharing is done to/from airports, and while in a city that you don’t live in. Pain points include not knowing which service will have the best rate (typically a longer ride to/from an airport than in-city), and not understanding local regulations and services. ABNB can approach this from a number of directions, the easiest is to act as the ‘booking agent’ for ride services, soliciting bids and then redirecting the user into the appropriate app (ideally with some of the flow completed). Don’t think ride sharing services would do something like this? Google Maps on mobile already does for Uber and Lyft - this service can be extended to a deeper integration that covers those services as well as local services around the world.

**Same-hour delivery**

I see two main cases for fast-delivery services: food and essentials. Food is fairly obvious here - can we get food to where we’re staying at the same time we arrive from the airport? Can we get breakfast or lunch delivered the next day? Essentials seems like a no-brainer as well - forgot to pack toothpaste? No problem. Hungover in the morning from drinking too much wine? Get ibuprofen quickly. Similar to rideshare the easiest entrypoint here is as an intermediary service. Though you could see a world where services like rideshare and same-hour delivery are fast-growing segments for ABNB and they start taking them in-house.

**Membership Model**

The core of my plan if I were the ABNB CEO (hint: I’m not) would be to build out businesses around a recurring subscription model. There are two sides to this: individual, and enterprise. 

Individual memberships should offer discounts on services, addons/perks, and a reward program. The discount part is pretty self-explanatory. Flat discounts on products, probably additional bundled discounts for multiple services. Perks can be things like an extra checked bag when you fly through ABNB. The reward program is easy - you can already establish a hotel-style reward program and layer in other benefits as you expand into other industries.

Enterprise is a big space - a lot of companies will still be paying for employees to travel in the future. Locking in big corporations with a membership that gives them prime pricing on flights, hospitality, etc. will yield big, consistent revenues - and make Travel &amp; Expenses (T&amp;E) easier for companies. Imagine being able to manage your entire T&amp;E budget outside “client dinners” via ABNB because they cover flights, hospitality, food, and transportation - huge.

## Numbers

I’m not going to obsess over every single detail or get into super fine-grained detailed estimations. I’m going to do some back-of-the-envelope calculations to get an estimate of how much headroom there is for ABNB. ABNB’s TTM revenue is 3.63B, with a market cap of 115.87B which is about 32B of value for every 1B of revenue. 

**Flights &amp; Rail**

In 2019 the US airline industry accounted for 838 billion in revenue ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278372/revenue-of-commercial-airlines-worldwide/)). It’s expected to be 459B in 2021 as the country recovers from Coronavirus. I’m going to be what I think is conservative and say it returns to 2019 levels in the next 5-10 years but does not grow past it. So let’s say the total addressable market (TAM) here is 459B (US) + 25% for being able to internationalize \~ 575B - I think this is a pretty conservative estimate.

**Rideshare**

Estimated to be 218B by 2025 in the US (source). Let’s use the same 25% addition from above for internationalizing \~275B.

**Fast Delivery**

I think the comp here is food delivery. This is expected to be about 470B by 2025 in the US (source). We’ll add 25% for internationalization and 10% for other deliveries \~635B

**Membership Model**

I don’t think this adds TAM. I think this adds stability and an improved multiple on revenue. 

**Total**

My plan outlined above, assuming estimated growth with conservative multiples leads to 1.485T in additional TAM for ABNB to address. If they can address 10% of that TAM they would have 148.5B in additional annual revenues. 

## Upside

We’ve got a lot of estimates at this point (unfortunately none of us can actually predict the future) but I feel they’re on the conservative side. Let’s lay out a few potential cases…

**Conservative**: ABNB addresses 5% of the market above at ⅛  the revenue multiple they currently have on their stock. This would add 7.425B in annual revenue, ¼ of the current revenue multiple is 4 so we would add 29.7B in value for a total of 145.57B (\~25% growth).

**Base Case**: ABNB addresses 10% of the market above at ¼  the revenue multiple they currently have on their stock. This would add 14.85B in annual revenue, ¼ of the current revenue multiple is 8 so we would add 118.8B in value for a total of 234.67B (\~102.5% growth).

**Bull Case**: ABNB addresses 15% of the market above at ½ the revenue multiple they currently have on their stock. This would add 22.275B in annual revenue, ½  of the current revenue multiple is 16 so we would add 356.5B in value for a total of 481.37B (\~301% growth).

## Closing

ABNB is very overpriced for what it is today, but if you assume the multiple will average down and believe some of the bull case presented will happen - the upside is tremendous. If they are able to internationalize better than my baked in estimate, the upside is even higher. 

It’s not a risk-free investment however, we don’t know what if any of this ABNB will do, we don’t know when, and we don’t know how successful they will be. 

*My current opinion*: wait until it’s been on the market because some folks who have been underpaid for years (they couldn’t sell any of their options) compared to peers will want to cash in a bit. We should see a dip from this insider selling (Mid-June if it’s a standard 6 month window) which should make for an attractive entrypoint for a many-year position."|investing|The Bull Case for ABNB (DD)|4.0|0.57

SND - Smart Sand Inc. They sell sand... LOL. Not only for fracking, but for other industrial uses and to other countries around the world.

Revenue and Income has been increasing almost exponentially for 5 years according to the financials. They made a Net Income (Profit) of $36M in 2020 (during the pandemic), the highest in 5 years. Their Market Cap is $90M, so this income level is pretty ridiculous.

Current Price: $2.35

**Book Value Price: $8.00 (estimated)**

**Outstanding Shares: 39 Million**

**Float: 22 Million**

According to my research, the book value based on accounting of assets/liabilities, etc, this stock is valued at nearly $8.00. So at a current price of $2.35, you are literally buying $1.00 of company for $0.29. This is *exceedingly* undervalued for a highly profitable company.

This $8.00 price target is simply the intrinsic value (a bare minimum price target), we are not even factoring in the low float and a realistic stock price, which is typically much more than book value for profitable companies. 3x bagger just to the book value. Realistically 10x-20x bagger if people knew about this stock and the price went to normal.

The other good thing going for it is the are gradually buying back their shares, so the outstanding share count has been slowly decreasing these past few years. I don't see that happen too often. Stock is up 15% today. Who wants to make a ton of money quickly? Tell people about this stock and try to buy in before anyone else knows about it.

DISCLAIMER: I bought nearly 50,000 shares today, got in cheap before letting everyone else know about it. Using the same research methods, I came across another stock called ENKS before anyone knew about it, but it looked ""too good to be true"", had the same good financials. It was $0.05/share at the time, was going to go all-in, I hesitated too long and now it's $2.00... I'm not making the same mistake this time around with SND.

====================================================

**My commentary:**

Glu is mobile games developer best known for, as they put it, games enjoyed by female gamers. Their main franchises include Diner Dash Adventures, Kim Kardashian Hollywood and Design Home. Although they also develop sport games that would compliment EA's portfolio well. Their sport games include Tap Sports Baseball, Deer Hunter and others. They also develop licensed games like WWE Universe and Disney Sorcerer’s Arena.

We all know EA so I wont bother. However, important to know that recently EA is having some hard time. They lost Star Wars franchise exclusivity, their loot boxes are facing regulatory pressure in Europe and their first party IPs are recently failing. EAs biggest revenue driver is EA Sports live services revenue which in plain English are FIFA loot boxes. Also, with failing first party IPs EA is at a mercy of their sports games licensors. Not great position to be in. EA has also recently announced quarterly dividend which was understood by some analysts as indication of slowing growth. EA's other recent acquisition was Codemasters who are UK racing games developers. Codemasters games include Dirt, Grid and Colin McRae Rally. However, it seems like EA does not care much for Codemaster's original IPs. Instead they rather wanted to acquire Codemaster's F1 licensing deal. As they have admitted during the last investors call, they see great potential for monetizing F1 franchise in similar ways to FIFA games.

Overall, markets seem to like EA's acquisition of Glu as shares are up post market. I'm more bearish on EA even with gaming sector growing at record speed. I think there are better game developers to invest in. Although, I will admit that current EA's valuation is quite tempting and dividend makes it even more so. Also, whether you like it or not if they manage to monetize F1 franchise and release more casual mobile games these acquisitions could be major revenue growth drivers.

Edit: It seems like many investors are not happy with $12.50 per share offer which they believe significantly undervalues the company. On the other hand this sounds like done deal so not much to be done.

====================================================

Edit: EAs strategic rationale for the acquisition includes:

Creating a Leading Mobile Portfolio Across Key Genres. The complementary nature of Electronic Arts and Glu’s successful products will create a portfolio that spans many of the biggest and most popular genres of mobile games, including sports, RPG, lifestyle, casual, and mid-core games. The combined organization will have a demographically diverse audience, with significant opportunities for franchise and market expansion.

Expanding Successful, Scalable Live Services. Both Electronic Arts and Glu have proven success creating mobile live service games that deeply engage large communities over many years and deliver strong recurring revenue. The combined expertise of the two organizations unlocks potential for further success. Glu’s franchises like Design Home, Covet Fashion, and MLB Tap Sports Baseball will benefit from Electronic Arts’ global licensing and distribution capabilities to bring them to new markets and more players. Glu’s expertise in building and monetizing sports and casual mobile games, combined with Electronic Arts’ industry-leading IP in sports and beyond, will accelerate the creation of exciting new experiences for broad audiences.

Experienced Creative Leadership &amp; Enhanced Team Capabilities. Glu brings a talented team including more than 500 mobile game developers (and nearly 800 total employees), adding significant scale to Electronic Arts’ mobile-focused organization. Glu’s creative leaders are established and well-known to Electronic Arts, with similar focus on creating highly successful mobile games with longevity. The combination of proven mobile leadership, deeply talented teams, genre expertise, long-running franchises and IP, and technology across the two organizations will be a catalyst to delivering new experiences and further growth.

Accelerating Growth. The combination of Electronic Arts and Glu will be a mobile growth engine. With strong, recurring revenue across a leading portfolio of live services, strength in key mobile genres, a deep roster of owned and licensed IP, access to a large-scale and growing player network, and ability to reach into new regions and markets, the acquisition will be immediately accretive to EA’s total net bookings and is expected to grow underlying profitability beginning in its first year.

Under those assumptions, why don't people set their families up to create or build extreme wealth overtime? For example, following the assumption that most reasonable investments will double every 8 years; why doesn't a family or individual simply set $100k aside in some form of low risk investment and let it build until it's so large that the family would have little or no fear of ever running out (under reasonable spending habits). Only then releasing it via a family trust or other suitable agreement to be used only under strict circumstances or for specific purposes, such as for education? In 80 years that $100k would have likely doubled 10 times and would be worth over $500 million, that seems like enough to ensure the education (or other similarly important things) for future generations of family. 

Why don't people do this? Is it because a family might grow at a faster rate than the investment and thus become so diluted it doesn't matter? Is it impossible to create a will, trust, or similar thing that would create that scenario? Or, is it simply just that people don't care to and aren't often concerned with the idea of creating something that won't effect them and even 3-4 generations after them?

EDIT:  For those of you getting fixated on how $100k is still a lot of money, instead apply the same logic above to just starting with $1000 initially. Starting with just a $1000 initial investment would only delay the process by about 56 years.

# Six facts about stocks that will puzzle you

**Hardly any general insights can be derived from most studies on stocks. They usually focus on only one country or are based on time series that are too short. Historical price data from 23 country stock exchanges going back to 1900 paints a more realistic picture of the stock markets and dispels supposed certainties.**

Researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton are a financial market institution. The researchers constructed time series for major asset classes based on historical sources dating back to 1900. The data show, for example, what returns equities have yielded over 118 years in 23 different countries. In turn, the financial market researchers used the country data to develop a world equity index that represents more than 90 percent of globally tradable stocks, as measured by market capitalization.

The data offers investors a more realistic view of the characteristics of stocks and dispels several myths. This is because market studies are usually either based on performance over only a very short period of time, or they focus solely on the U.S., the largest and best-documented stock market in the world today.

But this approach distorts reality. After all, short periods of a few years or decades are hardly meaningful, and stock market development in the U.S. is a unique success story whose results cannot be transferred to other countries.

Thus, long-term market data from 23 countries paints a different picture of international stock markets that will turn many investors' perceptions upside down.

## 1. High real interest rates are followed by higher stock returns

""Rising interest rates are poison for stock markets,"" is a truism among investors and journalists. It is based on the observation that stock prices often fall when interest rates rise unexpectedly. But that is a very incomplete view of what happens in the stock market over the longer term. Historical stock price trends in 21 countries point in the opposite direction: real stock returns, which are **returns** net of inflation, were low when real interest rates were low and they were high when real interest rates were high.

If real interest rates were 9.4 percent or more in any one year over the past 118 years, real stock returns added up to an average of just under 11 percent per year over the following five years. When real interest rates were minus 11 percent or less, investors made losses of 5.5 percent a year on stocks over the following five years.

During periods of very high negative real interest rates, inflation was also high in the last century. Today, nominal interest rates are at historic lows, but real interest rates are not, because consumer prices are also rising at a low rate.

The fact that the longer-term relationship between real interest rates and stock returns has been positive is no surprise to financial market researchers. After all, this is exactly the result that theory suggests. According to this theory, the short-term real interest rate for bonds with maturities of less than one year is the so-called risk-free interest rate. For risky investments such as stocks, investors demand a premium, the risk premium. The real return on equities therefore consists of the risk-free interest rate and the risk premium. If the real interest rate falls, the return on equities must also fall if the risk premium remains the same.

Conclusion for investors: there is no need to get anxious if real interest rates rise. In the short term, stock prices may fall. But over the longer term, investors can expect higher real returns from equities.

## 2. Stocks are riskier than most investors believe

The financial industry and many media outlets that have been taken in by it, or are themselves part of it, like to promote equities. In times of record low interest rates, this high-yield asset class is indispensable for asset accumulation. After all, share certificates in companies are not that risky in the long run, they often say.

As an example, the propagandists cite, among other things, the yield development of the German stock index DAX. Anyone who invested in the index at any time between 1949 and 2017 and held the investment for at least 15 years always achieved a positive return.

These data are impressive and illustrate that stocks are a long-term investment. But they gloss over risk and exaggerate returns because they tell only half the story:

1. The time period chosen excludes the much worse decades before 1949.
2. The returns are nominal, i.e., not adjusted for inflation.

For investors, nominal returns are just smoke and mirrors. They say nothing about the actual growth or loss of assets. Only real returns, which are adjusted for inflation, provide information on this. They show how an investor's purchasing power has developed. If, for example, the nominal return is positive but the inflation rate is higher within a given period, the real return is negative. This means that an investor's real assets and purchasing power are declining.

Since 1900, consumer prices in countries with developed stock markets have tended to rise, interrupted by only a few episodes in which inflation declined. Nominal returns are therefore higher than real returns, from which inflation has been removed.

As only nominal returns are quoted by the financial industry and in the media, the impression conveyed by these figures is distorted. Investors are led to believe that their assets have grown more than they actually did. Losses are also lower on a nominal basis than in real terms as long as inflation is rising.

Looking at the full story of German equities unearthed by researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, the world no longer looks quite so rosy. Their data set spans from 1900 to 2017, so it also includes the two world wars, the period of hyperinflation and the crash on Wall Street in the early 1930s.

During World War 2 and in the years that followed, German stocks lost a total of 96 percent of their value in real terms. From 1900 to 1954, investors made no profit on German stocks. The accumulated real return after 54 years was minus 3 percent. A buy-and-hold strategy during this period would therefore only have preserved purchasing power, but would not have led to any real increase in wealth.

The stock markets of other countries such as France and Japan also had to endure similarly long lean periods. The longest period without real asset growth on the world stock market was less than half as long. It was only 22 years (1910-1931). This underscores how incredibly important it is to diversify a portfolio internationally and not to get too involved in a single country stock market.

Measured against the world stock market, the two world wars were by no means the worst periods that shareholders had to endure. The losses after the stock market crash in the 1930s, the oil price shock in the early 1970s, the bursting of the Internet bubble at the turn of the millennium and after the financial crisis of 2008 were considerably higher.

From 1900 to 2017, investors in German equities achieved an average annual nominal return of 8.4 percent. In real terms, however, i.e. after deducting inflation, the return on equities was only 3.4 percent.

It is true: German equities, as well as those of other countries with developed stock markets, have risen over the long term. However, the lean periods that investors had to endure were considerably longer than time series show, which only cover the sunny side of the 20th century and are not adjusted for inflation. For from 1950 to the end of 1999, the real return on the world stock market was an impressive 8.6 percent per year, while investors from 1900 to 1949 achieved only 2.7 percent after deducting inflation.

## 3. Economies with high economic growth do not deliver above-average returns on shares

Many banks suggest to their customers that where the economy is booming, there are particularly high profits to be made on stocks. As proof, they like to cite the rapid economic growth in emerging economies such as India and Brazil and the fabulous returns that have been achieved there since the turn of the millennium compared with the slower-growing industrialized countries. Especially in the years before the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, banks were beating the drum for investments in the so-called emerging markets, when stock returns there were literally skyrocketing.

But returns over short periods of time raise false hopes. If you want to know something about the true character of the stock markets in the emerging markets, you have to take a closer look at the long-term development. And it looks less glorious than many investors probably expected.

While stocks in developed countries such as the U.S., the U.K. and Germany returned an average annual gain of 8.4 percent from 1900 to 2017, inclusive, the figure for fast-growing emerging markets was just 7.4 percent.

One percentage point may not seem like much, but over 118 years, this difference leads to a huge difference in total wealth: In the industrialized countries, one invested U.S. dollar increased to $12,877, while in the emerging markets, according to calculations by financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, the figure was just $4,367.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the stock markets of the developed countries were sometimes ahead, sometimes those of the emerging countries. At times, they rose in parallel. But after World War 2, the emerging markets crashed. In Japan, which was not yet an industrialized country at the time, the stock market lost 98 percent of its value, measured in U.S. dollars. In China, investors suffered a total loss after the communists came to power and the stock markets were closed in 1949. In other emerging markets such as Spain and South Africa, stocks performed poorly because of the aftermath of World War 2.

It was not until 1950 that emerging markets picked up again. By the end of 2017, they averaged 12.1 percent returns per year compared with 10.8 percent in the developed world. But the annual lead of 1.3 percentage points on average over the past 68 years was not enough to fully make up the shortfall from the 1940s. Over the entire 118-year study period, the established, slower-growing industrialized countries delivered the higher stock returns.

For their study, Dimson, Marsh and Staunton ranked the individual countries according to a simple rule that has become widely accepted among providers of stock indices. According to this rule, countries with a per capita economic output of at least $25,000 a year are considered developed countries. Countries that generate lower GDP per capita are considered emerging markets.

The data show that, contrary to what the financial industry often claims, there is no positive correlation between economic growth and stock returns. Other studies tended to find higher stock returns in countries with weak growth, i.e. a negative correlation.

There is no clear evidence as to why this is the case. Researchers discuss various possible explanantions:

1. **High valuations**. When investors prefer to invest in countries with high economic growth, share prices there rise, and with them valuations. The result of high market valuations is often below-average returns.
2. **Global instead of local**. Many listed companies operate globally. Economic growth in their home country is not decisive for them. In other words, even in real economic terms, there is not necessarily a correlation between GDP growth and corporate performance.
3. **Dilution effects**. High economic growth must also be financed. Many listed companies finance their expansion by issuing new shares. While profits may rise, they are spread over more and more shares. This results in a dilution effect that leads to lower returns.

Investors should therefore not be impressed by high growth data and forecasts. They are not an indication of above-average stock returns in the future. These tend to be offered by slow-growing countries with undervalued stock markets.

## 4. Shares are no hedge against inflation

There is a persistent belief among many media professionals that stocks are a good hedge against inflation. The argumentation they use to support this (unfortunately untenable) thesis goes something like this: If inflation rises, companies can raise their prices to adjust to the new level. This increases their profits, which in turn leads to rising stock returns.

This argument does not hold water for several reasons. Perhaps the most important is that the numbers show the exact opposite. Stocks are not a hedge against inflation.

What professional investors expect from a hedge is immediate and, if possible, equivalent compensation as soon as the event of loss occurs. This means that if, for example, inflation rises from 2 and 4 percent, the nominal return on equities should also rise by at least 2 percentage points at the same time. That would be a 100 percent hedge. The real return, i.e. the return after deducting inflation, would remain unaffected by inflationary spikes.

But this example is no more than wishful thinking. For as inflation rises, the real returns on equities fall - and vice versa. International equities as an asset class therefore offer a hedge against deflation, but not against inflation. The financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton prove this on the basis of 21 countries whose data series go back to 1900.

According to these data, investors in international equities achieved the highest real returns (11 to 12 percent) in the past when the inflation rate remained below 2 percent. In the past, a 10 percent increase in inflation led to a decline in real stock returns of about 5 percent.

If the extreme cases of hyperinflation (Germany, 1922-23, Finland 1918, Italy 1944, Japan 1946) are included in the calculation, equities perform somewhat better. Real returns fell by 3.5 percent when inflation rose by 10 percent.

Other studies support these findings. They also show that the relationship between real stock returns and inflation is negative. However, economists are still unable to provide a clear explanation as to why this is the case. What is clear, in any case, is that in the short term, stock prices do not necessarily follow corporate profits, which may determine returns in the long run. In the short term, it is rather factors such as monetary policy and investors' risk appetite that are decisive.

Because the latter usually falls when inflation rates rise, investors demand higher risk premiums for stocks, which depresses their prices, according to one theory. This theory is supported by the negative correlation between stock valuations measured by price-earnings ratios (P/E ratios) and inflation. American stocks, for example, were highly valued between 1970 and 2010 when inflation was low and vice versa.

Even though real stock returns decline as inflation rises - the bottom line has historically been positive as long as inflation has not exceeded 19 percent. So, on average, nominal stock returns have been higher than inflation. But this does not equate to an effective hedge against rising consumer prices (see above).

## 5. Less risk, more return

The more returns investors want to achieve, the higher the risks they have to take, is a widely accepted financial market theory. An empirical comparison of individual asset classes confirms this correlation. Since 1900, stocks have been the asset class with the highest return. At the same time, however, the risk measured in terms of volatility was also the highest. Government bonds of more than one year generated lower gains, but fluctuated less. Government bonds with maturities of less than one year, so-called money market paper, were the safest, but also the least lucrative.

However, if we look at individual countries within the equity asset class, the relationship between risk and return is no longer so clear. Rather, the data point in the opposite direction. In countries whose stock markets fluctuated comparatively less, investors tended to generate higher returns (see charts). A good third of the returns can be explained by volatility, as the regression analysis shows.

**Equity markets with low volatility tended to generate higher returns**

## 6. Dividends are the main source of return on shares in the long term.

Speculators hoping to make quick profits on the stock markets pay particular attention to the price performance of shares. In the short term, share prices can fluctuate enormously. Within a year, for example, a 40 percent gain or loss is possible.

But these capital gains and losses, which determine real stock returns in the short term, play only a minor role for serious investors who want to build up and increase their assets over the long term. The longer the investment period, the more important reinvested dividends become. According to calculations by financial market researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, dividend yields have contributed around 80 percent to total returns on the world stock market since 1900. In the U.S., it was about two-thirds, and in Germany it was as much as 100 percent, because the annual capital gain was negative at minus 0.23 percent.

---------------------------------------------------------

Specifically, this part confuses me:

&gt;Because the latter usually falls when inflation rates rise, investors demand higher risk premiums for stocks, which depresses their prices

Isn't the price (minus the risk-free interest) exactly the risk premium in case of stocks? I don't see how the risk premium can increase while the price decreases.

Also, while the text was updated in 2020 and the referenced study is from 2018, it feels like it disregards modern developments like tech companies. On the other hand, ""this time it's different"" might also apply here in the sense that current tech innovation might not be permanent growth guarantee just like innovation in the 20th century wasn't."|investing|Actual profits in stock markets|35.0|0.84

However, there was one stock that I looked at seriously and decided to buy into, and that was $ZOM.

I now own 50 shares of this stock, and over the past three days have watched it start to go really high and as of this writing is sitting at 26% and climbing growth (44% for today).

Some of the points they mention appear to be reasonably sound:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The market for these services is large, and expected to grow. In a press release, Zomedica cites “the diagnostics segment of the global companion animal market is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2024.” To put that in context, that’s a nearly 10% compound annual growth rate. 

This is a relatively new field that is expected to grow. They also point out that since Covid, there has been a rise in pet ownership, all of whom will need veterinary care for their beloved animals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; ...once TruForma is ready, Zomedica is taking steps to make sure it can get the product in the hands of veterinarians as soon as possible. The company has [signed a distribution agreement](https://investors.zomedica.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zomedica-signs-truformatm-distribution-agreement-miller) with Miller Veterinary Supply. Miller, supported by the company’s sales reps will cover the U.S. from Maine to Texas. 

Their TruForma diagnostics is a sure thing to be released, and it looks like they already have the product's distribution secured. These various elements and it's continued stock growth, I admit have me a bit excited.

"" National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: FIZZ) today announced its Board of Directors declared a **one-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend**. This dividend will be distributed on February 19, 2021 to shareholders of record on February 16, 2021. Trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on February 22, 2021. ""

My understanding is that this is may affect the stock **differently** than a 2 for 1 stock split might (although I see a [Motley Fool article](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/m/a9eada17-bd44-3d07-a581-fcd035ee7793/national-beverage-plans-a.html) that says its the same) .

For those more knowledgeable, I have some questions:

1. In a 2 for 1 stock split, the price of the stock gets divided in half as well. **But how would a 1 for 1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend affect the stock price?** 
2. From this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/if-investor-short-dividendpaying-stock-record-date-are-they-entitled-dividend.asp), it says "" If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are not entitled to the dividend.﻿ In fact, the investor is instead responsible for paying the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed."" **Does this mean if short sellers do not cover before the record date, they will need to return twice the number of stocks they borrowed, even though they only short sold one stock?**
3. On January 21, they also announced a dividend pay out of $6 per share which was a record high. **From speculating, are these dividend payouts (stock and cash) so close together like this before their earnings date in March bullish or bearish signs? Are they trying to keep shareholders from selling because there is bad news coming?**

Its products include Alferon N Injection and  Ampligen. The Alferon N Injection is a purified, natural source,  glycosylated, multispecies alpha interferon product, composed of eight  forms of high-purified alpha interferon. The Ampligen is used in the  treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and as a vaccine enhancer for  therapeutic and/or preventative development related to influenza and  cancer treatments.

The reason why I'm bullish on this company NOW is because they have extremely recently released news that makes their immediate future look extremely optimistic. For one, they announced last Friday (Feb. 5th) that they had been able to secure funding for their new nasal-applied COVID therapy.

With that news alone the requirements are made for both TD Securities and Maxim Group's price target of 5.5 - 6.5$ are met and the immediate future of the company would look bright given the company's robust financial past and ability to have drugs successfully pass the human clinical stage.

However, that's not all. As of this morning the European Union has granted the Orphan Drug Designation for Rintatolimod which is a drug used in treatment for pancreatic cancer.

It is now six months after ABML brought in Paul, and the stock has risen 4800%. In the last Covid relief bill, there were grants for multiple billions of dollars for critical material production, critical material recycling, energy storage recycling, and energy storage tech (download the bill and try ctrl+f “energy storage,” “recycl,” or “critical material”). Those are just the appropriations that I could find in an hour; it is possible, even certain, that there are other funding mechanisms that I missed. Many of these grants will be made available to private industry. It is safe to assume that when Paul Pelosi Jr. is on the board of Altair (ATAO), they will get preferential treatment. Conflict of interest? Maybe, but that is not my concern. Additionally, we are about to get an even larger stimulus bill, and supposedly an infrastructure bill after that. Likely these future bills will also earmark funding to help kickstart ATAO’s recycling process.

But isn’t ATAO just a lithium exploration company? No, Altair recently entered into an agreement with St-Georges Eco-Mining Corp. (SXOOF) “to establish a mutually beneficial partnership for the commercial implementation and output of battery recycling technology.” ATAO and SXOOF will each retain 50% ownership of this venture. 

Why not just buy ABML? I am still holding because it still does have the chance of being the first commercially viable lithium battery recycler. Yes, ABML has roughly 4x the amount of exploratory land as ATAO, but the main draw to ABML has been its recycling process. However, with a market cap of 2B, it seems unlikely to go up another 1000% in the short term. The founder of ABML, Craig Alford, has left ABML and started a new competitor called Barrel Energy (BRLL trading at a mere 10M market cap!), which is also in a partnership with ATAO. Unlike ABML (or even SXOOF), ATAO has not yet experienced a significant price increase. The market appears not yet to have priced in ATAO’s entry into the recycling race. ABML may be further ahead in development, but not years ahead. With an explosion of federal R&amp;D funding, ATAO and BRLL should become major competitors of ABML.

1. Pull out the 10k and put it in a savings account with my other 14k. I heard that you shouldn't invest money you plan on using within a year. It might take a little longer than a year for me to buy a house though.

Below I'll provide some DD on one of my favorite opportunities over the next few weeks.

KemPharm is a pharmaceutical company located in Florida which focuses on the improvement of proprietary drugs. Right now they have 4 different drugs up for approval in 2021 and various already approved drugs. The big one is their KP415 which is up for PDUFA approval on March 2nd and has shown strong results in their trials. If approved, they've said that this has the potential to be one of the first truly differentiated products launched in the ADHD market. It has a lesser abuse rate and a longer effect duration.

That's the short term but more importantly this company has undergone a massive change in the past few months. Three months ago, they were in debt to Deerfield, a healthcare ecosystem, for over $75 million due in March 2021. As of recently, they paid off this debt and are debt free with a good amount of cash + would get $50 million once the drug is approved putting them way over their cash burn rate.

Secondly, don't just trust me. The current price targets by two different analysts is pegged at $24-$28. For the downside, I didn't have the desire to perform a DCF but WallStreetZen has a $7.5 fair value. It also has about 30% short interest so we'll likely be aided by a squeeze.

So continuing this analogy, predicting the financial markets is like predicting the weather. Active funds with all their advanced models are like the professional weather stations. Efficient market hypothesis and ""priced-in"" is akin to aggregating the consensus of all weather stations. Their advanced physics models and computer simulations could still incorrectly predict the weather though, but they're still much better than the average person looking at the sky. As with weather, the price of assets converge to reality as time approaches; today's weather forecast is much more accurate than next week's, and yesterday's weather forecast is 100% accurate.

For the vast majority of retail investors, investing in the EMH through index funds is still the best option because weather stations are still damn accurate. However, even with EMH there's still a large degree of inaccuracy, and there are plenty of profits to be made if you can come up with a better model at predicting the weather.

Another relevant analogy is predicting elections. The stock market is a voting machine in the short term and weighing machine in the long term.

Although the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibited the use of insider information in making trades, the (ITSFEA) expanded penalties for insider trading and securities fraud. An insider is any person who has access to nonpublic information about a company.

Inside information is any material information that has not been disseminated to, or is not readily available to , the general public.
The act prohibits insiders trading on or communicating nonpublic information.

No trade need be made for a violation to occur; even a personal benefit of a non-financial nature could lead to liability under the rules.

So, the key elements of liability under insider trading rules are as follows:
1.) Does the tipper owe a fiduciary duty to a company/its stockholders? Has he breached it?
2.) Does the tipper meet the personal benefits test ( even something as simple as enhancing a friendship or reputation)?
3.) Does the tippee know or should the tippee have known that the information was inside or confidential?
4.) Is the information material and nonpublic?

# Key takeaway.

Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) is extremely undervalued by any metric. Don’t be put off by its 22% rise since the end of January – it’s still playing catch-up to its fair valuation (based on historical metrics). Even without taking into account its impressive track record of growth, a fair valuation for OPY would be $79.00. If we also consider its growth trajectory and compare it to its peers, its value could surpass even that.

Positions: 100 shares at $38.02; 10 Jun18 35 CALLS 

&amp;#x200B;

# Company profile.

Oppenheimer Holdings is a small-cap investment bank, market maker, and financial services company that’s been in operation since the late 1800s. They’re active mostly in the US, although they have branches in Europe, China, and Tel Aviv. They offer wealth management, brokerage services, and advisory services, and act as underwriters for IPOs. They were involved in the IPOs of AirBnB, DraftKings, and Fubo. They’ve been targeted for acquisition a number of times in the distant past, but the deals have never been realized.

As a small-cap stock, they’re woefully under-covered. The latest Seeking Alpha article is from 2016, and there aren’t any analyst ratings for the stock. This lack of coverage represents an opportunity, as OPY appears to be severely undervalued since it is so overlooked. They could also be a target for acquisition in the future, but I’m not factoring this into my thesis.

# Performance.

OPY benefited in 2020 from a high-volatility trading environment that oversaw an increase in retail and institutional commissions. Their investment banking and underwriting branches saw record numbers this past year. 

Furthermore, Oppenheimer has been undergoing sustained growth since some dismal earnings in 2016. Take a look at its EPS:

Net income per share (diluted):

|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$1.77|$0.62|$0.14|\-$0.09|$1.67|$2.05|$3.82|$9.30|

2020’s incredible earnings put OPY’s P/E at roughly 4.04. That means that if the company’s earnings stay stagnant and neither grow nor decline, and if the stock price stays exactly where it is, it will take roughly only four years for the company to earn enough cash equivalent to the current value of the company. That’s an amazing deal. 

So, how does OPY’s low P/E compare to its historical P/E?

&amp;#x200B;

# Historical P/E ratios.

&amp;#x200B;

|2018|2019|2020|Avg. of past 3 yrs|Current|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|8.5|10.7|6.3|8.5|4.05|

To revert to its historical average P/E, OPY would have to more than double in share value. [We can even see that OPY's P/E right before earnigns was 6.35](http://Ycharts.com/companies/OPY/pe_ratio). In light of recent earnings, OPY’s P/E was recalculated to 3.39, and has continued to climb to 4.05 as the market has been pricing in these exceptional earnings. But even in spite of the reduced risk of post-earnings, and in spite of the company's excellent earnings and growth track, and in spite of the stock's climb, OPY is still nowhere near its average P/E of 8.5. The only time its P/E was any lower was in 2012, 2016, and 2017, when the company had a loss per share. To reach its average P/E of the past three years, OPY would either have to double in price, or it would have to suffer substantial negative growth next year -- and I don't see any potential catalyst for the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

# Current P/E comparison to competitors.

That's all well and good, but how does OPY compare to its closest competitors and their P/E? Maybe *all* financials currently have a low PE?

Competitors:

|Oppenheimer (OPY)|Cowen|Piper Sandler|Berkshire Bank|TrustCo Bank Corp|Century Bancorp|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|4.05|6.8|37.15|17.76^(\*)|11.98|14.52|

^(\*Avg of previous five years as they took a loss last year)

Even when compared to its competitors, OPY is still undervalued -- and when taken in context of the market as a whole, that undervaluation is even more evident: the average P/E of the S&amp;P is around 19.45 (although it's currently around 35.5). OPY is trading at a fraction of this.

&amp;#x200B;

# Other points to consider.

# Share buybacks.

Oppenheimer has also been buying back shares since 2016. Although their 10-K hasn’t yet been posted on the SEC website, they have posted an presentation containing their [unaudited 2020 results](https://www.oppenheimer.com/_assets/docs/earnings/2020/2020-8kq4-pr.pdf):

They bought back 718,522 shares in 2020. They currently have 13,217,335 shares outstanding.

This float is exceptionally low, so once the stock picks up momentum, it can really start making moves. The stock has low short interest, however, so don’t anticipate a squeeze of any sorts. It's also not a sexy company like ""dude weed lmao"" or fintech, so meme momentum probably won't send it higher. It's simply a stable, strong company that's currently underpriced, and the moves over the past couple of weeks indicate that the market *may* be starting to realize this.

# Dividends.

Oppenheimer has an annual dividend of $0.48, up from the previous years’ dividend of $0.44. Personally, I see this as detrimental to the stock, considering I’m taxed at a high rate on dividends, albeit not on capital gains. Others might view this as a boon to the stock. The dividend does also represent a nice cushion against any financial hardship – they can always cut the dividend if they start taking a loss. Its upcoming ex dividend date is Feb 11.

They also issued a special dividend of $1.00 as recently as 23 Dec 2020. Again, not beneficial for me. I’d prefer they do buybacks.

# Long-term Debt.

So what's the catch? The company must be heavily indebted, and are kicking the can down the street, right? Not so.

|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|
|199m|149m|125m|

OPY’s debt to equity ratio is 18.2% -- exceptionally low. Keep in mind that OPY had a net income of $82m in 2020 – enough to pay down more than half of their debt from just one year's earnings. Insolvency doesn’t appear likely.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bearish considerations.

In all honesty, I can't see many that wouldn't apply to other financial stocks and the stock market as a whole -- a black swan event, terrorist attack, that sort of thing. If the IPO market starts to cool off, or volatility starts to wane, or a plurality of hedge funds go defunct – all of these things could weigh on OPY’s stock. Of course, these risks are inherent to other investment banks as well, which already command a higher P/E ratio more representative of reality. If anyone has some compelling bearish arguments, I'd like to hear them.

I suppose a realistic concern is that, in the near term, momentum could dry up and the stock could take a dip. In that case, I'll be buying more with both hands. Furthermore, and though the two are often connected, the P/E ratio isn't something that inherently dictates the movement of a stock. It's entirely possible for the P/E ratio of the company to persist for a long period below 1, as the market overlooks and misprices this company.

# Conclusion.

OPY’s stock had been in a slow, sustained uptrend since September, and recently saw a drastic jump on some stellar earnings. It has been undergoing sustained and impressive growth since 2016, and has a low amount of debt. And yet, it still appears to be undervalued. Its P/E is extremely low compared to its historical average and compared to its competitors. In the short-term, OPY still needs to make up – and currently *is* making up – a lot of ground if it wants to revert back to its historical P/E. To do that, its share value would have to double. Even if it did double, I believe the company still offers good value in the long term, as its earnings have improved substantially over the past few years."|investing|An excellent OPY-rtunity in a small cap finance company|73.0|0.96

On 2/5/2021 they announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM’s will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the “2020 May Program” which facilitates the company’s repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company’s repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti “Fan Boys” such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise’s where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by “Fan Boys” and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company’s stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.“Fan Boys” are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out’s, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera’s loyal followers.

Litigation financing is an asset class that few have talked about here. It is, however, very lucrative. Returns are lumpy but significant. The business model is rather simple. Find someone with a claim, that (a) has little money or is (b) risk averse. Have smart lawyers look at the case details and evaluate the chances of winning the case (due diligence). If you think you can win: offer to pay for his lawyers and costs. In return get a share of the profits (usually 30% or more) if you win. Burford Capital is the biggest player in this game.

I believe BUR is significantly undervalued. I put my money where my mouth is and have invested &gt;100k. I will diamond hand this to USD 100+.

BUR has been attacked by the Short Seller Muddy Waters in 2019. Using phony made up scare tactics and the now well known ladder attacks, this has tanked the shareprice. Following the attack, one of the bigger investors in BUR (Neil Woodford) was forced to sell, further killing the sp. However, the company has completely [refuted](https://www.burfordcapital.com/media-room/media-room-container/response-to-short-attack/) the allegations and has brilliant prospects. I consider the risks to be limited, especially since BUR has been deeply scrutenized before their dual listing in the US in 2020.

While the stock price has recovered a great deal, it is far from its all time high of GBP 20 (=23 USD), currently trading at 9 USD. I think it can reach its all time high quickly and go far beyond that. With Brexit and Covid disrupting the economy, new legal cases will arise. This should lead to an expanding client demand.

Hard facts: P/E &gt; 13; Price to Book: 1.06. Which is ridiculous based on a cumulative historic ROIC of 88% (!). Those returns are completely uncorrelated to the overall market (courts decide independent of economy). The business model is hard to copy, as you need years of market activity to convince lawyers that you are reliable. So there are significant barriers to entry.

The company has currently USD 820 million USD deployed in ongoing assets. This is deployed in a large and diversified portfolio, the largest in the industry, having many cases helps mitigating the risks of losing any one case. It does not prevent you from losing cases, but on average, you will win more cases than you lose.

There are realistic possibilities for an amazing ROI.

\- The Peterson Case alone (that was already profitable for BUR bought at 20 million and already sold stakes in the case for 236 million, retaining 61.25% of its original entitlement) has now entered a late stage of the proceeding with the judge in NY being quite sympathetic to BURs claim. That claim could be up to 13 billion, 61% of which would be 8 bn (6x the market cap). Anyone should invest on these grounds alone. I have taken this bet, I believe that BUR has a &gt; 50% chance of winning.

\- VW and Trucks Cartel Cases have the potential of yielding USD 1.2 bn on a USD 30 million investment.

This is quite legendary, especially knowing that all the other cases of BUR (see graph attached) tend to win big. I think we have a winner here. The Lit-Financing asset class is not well known, so investors should have a great potential before the mainstream storms in.

I think price to book should be at least 3. I can see the book value land on USD 10 billion on invested capital. Market cap should be USD 30 bn. 219 million shares. Fair value USD 136 per share.

This is my personal opinion and not financial advice.

1612792814.0|0.0|t3_lfccpo|0.0|"Michael Saylor, founder of Microstrategy and an MIT alumni, has been aggressively promoting Lyn Alden's [BTC bullish thesis](https://www.lynalden.com/invest-in-bitcoin/) which can be summarized as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin has a supply cap of 21M coins
2. Bitcoin has an advantage over other cryptocurrencies because of its network effect

These 2 properties, according to Lyn, will help BTC perform like digital gold in a *quantitatively eased* covid world. The first statement, however, is inaccurate in the sense that Bitcoin does not have a supply cap and is not scarce in the same way as silver and gold are. Bitcoin's scarcity/supply cap is defined via a consensus similar to the one that regulates the supply of fiat currencies, that is a consensus that can be changed or can be manipulated. Whether by sheer ignorance, or tacit collusion, the promoters of this thesis should/may one day be held accountable in court for spreading a lie in order to lure in buyers at progressively higher prices.

# Why BTC does NOT have a supply cap

Supply in Bitcoin is regulated by an algorithm that limits the amount of new coins issued and defines the rules by which these newly minted coins are distributed. To mine *a coin* in BTC a miner has to solve a puzzle after which the blockchain is updated to increase the balance of his address by 1 unit. This would be a *mined coin,* since it did not come from another address through an incoming transaction.

According to today's algorithm there cannot be more than 21 million coins, and the amount of coins minted for every puzzle solved (which corresponds to *block found* in bitcoin lingo), is 12.5. This is known as the *block reward.* According to the same algorithm the block reward is supposed to halve every 4 years.

It is important to emphasize here that **we are speaking of an algorithm**, not a natural law. Such *algorithm* (which is part of bitcoin's protocol) is used by today's BTC miners. This algorithm seems to be sufficient for Michael Saylor (and Lyn Alden) to promote Bitcoin as a currency with *limited supply* and capable of fulfilling its role as *digital gold*. However, it is not.

Michael Saylor is a billionaire engineer, who seems to have a deep knowledge of the bitcoin community. At the same time, he seems to not be able to tell the difference between a natural supply cap and a supply cap set by social (or decentralized) consensus. It is exactly by glossing over such distinction that newcomers are lured to believe that BTC's supply is set in stone, and invest/buy as if BTC's supply is set in stone, when in fact that's not the case.

A natural supply cap is independent of political or social consensus. Even if the most powerful/influential leaders, policymakers, scholars, economists, engineers and so on of the world came together and agreed that there needed to be more silver on Earth, there is nothing they could do to change the total amount of silver. They could not because silver's supply is fixed.

A supply cap set via consensus, on the other hand, can be lifted or modified if the underlying consensus changes or is manipulated. This is the case of fiat currencies, where we have seen the consensus shift towards accommodative monetary policies that were unthinkable 4-5 decades ago.  And this is also the case with Bitcoin, the only difference between Bitcoin and fiat currencies is that today's consensus in Bitcoin veers towards sticking to the original 21M supply. While it is true that bitcoin's supply is defined by an algorithm, this *algorithm* can be changed. Therefore Bitcoin is not scarce, at least not in the same way as precious metals like gold and silver whose supply is independent of any form of consensus.

# Consensus shifts in Bitcoin's 10 year history

In Bitcoin's history there have already been instances of changes in consensus that have impacted its properties. For example in its early years Bitcoin was defined as digital peer to peer cash because it could be used as peer to peer cash, thanks to subcent fees, even for micro payments. But as adoption picked up, transaction fees increased and BTC's performance as cash deteriorated. The general consensus then started to favor digital gold over peer to peer cash. As this transition occurred, the *community* split in two camps that would clash with each other for years to come trying to reaffirm their own view as the *consensus view*. In this *fight for consensus* each side resorted, among others, to censorship, ad hominem attacks and industrial scale DDOS attacks in a proper cyberwar fashion. In the end small blockers (proponents of Bitcoin as digital gold) prevailed, while big blockers forked into BCH. This series of events matters because it proves that the same thing can/will happen one day with bitcoin's supply. Today the *let's increase supply* camp already counts some prominent BTC figures, like ex Bitcoin Core developer [Peter Todd](https://www.trustnodes.com/2019/03/26/peter-todd-advocates-raising-the-21-million-bitcoin-limit-hence-the-blocksize-constrain).

# Conclusion

There is no difference between BTC and fiat currencies like the US dollar technically speaking. The only difference is who is in charge, in BTC it is the Bitcoin Core developers while in the case of a fiat currency it is a central bank. Right now *consensus* in BTC is that the cap should stay at 21M. But if this consensus changes, then just like with fiat currencies, a lot of retail buyers who used BTC as digital gold would have to passively accept the change. This *risk* is what distinguishes a fixed supply currency from an inflationary currency. Not the consensus in a particular point in time."|investing|Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor and others are using their influence to spread lies about Bitcoin at the expense of other CEOs and retail buyers.

1612770175.0|0.0|t3_lf6vq1|26.0|"I recently learned about this company from a comment on this subreddit. They produce prodrugs: modified versions of existing medications that become active after being metabolized in the body. This can have some beneficial effects, chief amongst them being longer periods of activation and lower abuse potential. People are pretty excited about a new product of theirs, serdexmethylphenidate, which is undergoing FDA approval as a medication for ADHD, and which has potential as a medication for stimulant use disorder too.

As someone with ADHD I was pretty excited about this; there's definitely room for improvement in the existing medication regimes. But, after looking into it for a bit, I'm not sure that this company deserves the hype and attention that it's received in a few corners of the internet.

I would like to be a voice of sanity and reason.

I'll first summarize the bull case for KemPharm, and then I'll explain why I think the bull case is overblown and that caution is advised.

# The bull case for KemPharm

The bull case for KemPharm can be broken down into two parts:

**Serdexmethylphenidate is the next Vyvanse**

Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is an ADHD drug that was approved in 2007. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine; it has the same psychoactive effects as dextroamphetamine, but it lasts longer and you can't increase the potency of it by injecting it or snorting it, because its activation is limited by how quickly the body can metabolize it. It's been very successful because it is longer-lasting and can be marketed as being abuse-resistant.

There are two first-line ADHD treatments: amphetamines and methylphenidates. Amphetamines work better for some people, and methylphenidates work well for others. Vyvanse is a prodrug for amphetamines, but there is currently no prodrug for methylphenidates. Serdexmethylphenidate would fill that gap; whereas Ritalin (methylphenidate) lasts for about 4 hours, serdexmethylphenidate would last for about 13. And, like Vyvanse, you can't increase the potency by injecting it or snorting it.

Vyvanse currently brings in $2 billion in revenue *per quarter* (pg 55 of the [Takeda quarterly report](https://www.takeda.com/490228/siteassets/system/investors/quarterly-announcements/fy2020/qr2020_q3_qfr_en.pdf)). KemPharm has a market cap of $85 million. If serdexmethylphenidate can do for methylphenidates what Vyvanse did for amphetamines then the company is probably very undervalued. The CEO of KemPharm, notably, was the same guy who developed Vyvanse.

**Serdexmethylphenidate is the new Suboxone**

KemPharm is also investigating Serdexmethylphenidate as a treatment for stimulant use disorder. The idea here is that a recovering stimulant addict could take serdexmethylphenidate in place of (for example) cocaine or methamphetamine in order to avoid experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms during recovery. Clinical trial data (figures 1 and 3 in [this poster](https://kempharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/APSARD-2019-KMPH-KP415-A01-Oral-HAP-Poster-2019_0118-FINAL.pdf)) shows that serdexmethylphenidate scores only slightly higher than placebo in measures of ""drug liking"" and ""feeling high"", which suggests that it can be used by recovering addicts without further incentivizing addictive behavior.

Unlike opiates, for which there are treatments like suboxone, there are currently no FDA approved drugs for treating stimulant substance abuse. If this works out then KemPharm would have that market to itself.

# The bear case for KemPharm

Based on the data I've seen so far, I think it's definitely true that serdexmethylphenidate could be a very useful treatment for ADHD. I'd certainly try it if a doctor offered it to me. The potential efficacy of the medication does not necessarily translate into profound business opportunities, though. The people who point to the success of Vyvanse or Suboxone are missing important nuances in the situation that I think should make anyone take a pause before going all in.

**There isn't necessarily a lot of room for more ADHD medications**

Pharma companies love ADHD: roughly 5% of the population has it, people who have it tend to be medicated for life because there's no cure for it, and there's plenty of opportunity to patent new drugs by making iterative improvements to effective, already-established therapies, specifically methylphenidate and amphetamine. As a result there's a veritable zoo of ADHD medications available. There's already an option in this zoo for almost every use case: short-acting, long-acting, less-easily-abused, dermal patches, liquid medications, take-it-the-night-before, etc. Many of these are available in generic formulations, meaning that they are very cheap.

In order for people to use a new ADHD medication, they need to be unable to find a workable therapy in existing, generic medications. There are several reasons to think that there may not be that many people willing to pay out for serdexmethylphenidate.

* **We already have Concerta.** I compared Serdexmethylphenidate to Ritalin above, but Concerta is the better comparison. It is a methylphenidate pill that claims to last for about 12 hours and which is claimed to be less easy to abuse than Ritalin. In actual experience Concerta tends to last more like 9 hours, but that's still pretty good. And here's the thing: serdexmethylphenidate probably doesn't last any longer than Concerta does. Figures 1 and 2 of [this poster](https://kempharm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Poster_KP415.109_Braeckman_FINAL.pdf) show the blood plasma concentration of medication vs time for both Concerta and several formulations of serdexmethylphenidate. Concerta produces roughly the same blood plasma concentration of active medication over a 14 hour period that serdexmethylphenidate does, and - notably - it produces a substantially higher concentration in the afternoon. This is by design: Concerta was specifically designed so that blood plasma concentration would increase throughout the afternoon, [which has been shown to be more effective for treating children than a decreasing profile is](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/207174). KemPharm claims to have produced Serdexmethylphenidate specifically for treating children, but it probably won't work as well for children as Concerta does. And you can get Concerta as a generic medication for about $10 per month.
* **Mydayis isn't doing amazing.** In 2017 Takeda (which also makes Vyvanse) received approval for Mydayis, another new ADHD medication. It's basically a better version of Adderall XR; it lasts longer and produces less variation in blood plasma concentration than Adderall XR does. But if you look at page 55 of the same [Takeda quarterly report](https://www.takeda.com/490228/siteassets/system/investors/quarterly-announcements/fy2020/qr2020_q3_qfr_en.pdf) that I got the numbers for Vyvanse from, you'll see that Mydayis isn't producing enough revenue yet for Takeda to even bother breaking it out; revenue from Mydayis is included along with revenue from several other medications under ""other"". There's a simple reason for this: although Mydayis is objectively better than Adderall XR, it is also horrifically expensive (around $300 per month I think?). Adderall XR, on the other hand, is available as a generic medication for about $10 per month. No doctor, and certainly no insurance company, is going to give someone Mydayis without first having them try Adderall XR, and Adderall XR will work just fine for most people. This is probably what will happen for Concerta vs serdexmethylphenidate.
* **Vyvanse goes off patent in 2023.** Probably the principle selling point of prodrug ADHD medications is that you can't get high by snorting or injecting them; this puts the minds of anxious parents at ease (even though it probably isn't very important in practical terms). If you want a cheap, generic prodrug that works well for treating ADHD then you need only wait until 2023, when Vyvanse may become available as a generic. This means that KemPharm will only have about 2 years before it sees serious generic competition for serdexmethylphenidate. That's not a lot of time to make a lot of money; Vyvanse is a powerhouse now, but it was first released 13 years ago in 2007, and it was promoted for a long time with a fairly aggressive marketing campaign. How much of a foothold can serdexmethylphenidate get in 2 years?

**Treatment for stimulant use disorder is a wildcard at best**

I don't have any experience with addiction or addiction treatment, so I can't comment on this issue in great detail. There is just one important nuance I'd like to point out, though: the purported substance abuse resistance of ADHD prodrugs isn't really true. You can't rapidly increase your blood plasma concentration of amphetamine by injecting or snorting Vyvanse, but you *can* do that by taking 5 or 10 pills instead of taking just 1. A drug addict with unfettered access to Vyvanse will manage to get high, if they're so inclined. The substance abuse resistance angle is mostly a marketing tactic for selling ADHD medication to parents who are fearful of amphetamines because their understanding of those drugs is informed primarily by popular culture.

~~One of the things that makes suboxone useful for treating opiate addiction is that you actually can't get high with it, no matter how much you take.~~ \[EDIT: this was inaccurate; thanks [rtill002](https://www.reddit.com/user/rtill002/)\] The same is almost certainly is not true of serdexmethylphenidate: we know only that people don't get high from taking it *at normal therapeutic doses*. But, as with Vyvanse, you can almost certainly get high with it if you take a large enough dose by eating multiple pills.

The FDA may none the less decide to approve serdexmethylphenidate for stimulant use disorder; I don't know enough about treating that to be able to say with confidence what the outcome will be. But I think the reasons I gave above are a good reason to have doubts.

# Summary

KemPharm is popular in some circles because of the promise of its new ADHD drug serdexmethylphenidate. This is probably a good medication, but expectations that it will be spectacularly profitable (a la Vyvanse) are probably very overblown: the most natural customer for it is probably an adult with ADHD who prefers methylphenidates over amphetamines (most adults are the opposite), but who dislikes the fact that Concerta is more active in the afternoon (also unusual), and who also has a lot of money to shell out for medication. That's not a large market segment. The prospect of using serdexmethylphenidate for treating stimulant addiction is very uncertain, especially in light of the fact that its purported substance abuse resistance is likely more of a marketing tactic than medicinal fact.

I am neither long nor short KemPharm. I'd like to be long, if anyone can convince me that I'm wrong about the above."|investing|The bear case for KemPharm (KMPH)|26.0|0.83

They are cross-relating magic with dungeons and dragons for the first time in 30 years with the next expansion which will likely drag a new nerdy and reasonably wealthy user base. And magic is coming as a series in netflix which will further expand the user base.

If you try to play the game you can infer how many users they have by studying the distribution of waiting times to find an opponent across different game options. Moreover, if you study the end-year report statistics related to your player profile that they send in december they disclose in what quantile your frequency of plays ends up. From these two data you can build up an approximate revenue model.

1612754816.0|0.0|t3_lf2v45|16.0|"What is ... gold

 Although gold looks like a metal, in terms of its properties it is more likely the oldest currency or financial asset.  Less than 10% of the gold produced in the world is used in the industry, while the majority is used for investment, savings and jewelry production - also a kind of savings.  At the same time, gold as a financial asset has several characteristics that are interesting from an investment point of view.

 First, it generates zero real returns.  That is, you bought an ingot of gold, and a year later it is the same ingot of gold.  In the ordinary world, zero profitability is very little.  But in a world where trillions of dollars in debt yields negative nominal yields, 0% yields are taking on new colors.  Therefore, investment demand for gold is growing and has every chance of continuing to grow in the foreseeable future.

 Second, gold mining is limited by the production capacity of gold miners.  In 2020, the United States printed 20% of the dollars already available at the beginning of the year.  And usually a textbook on macroeconomics suggests that in such cases, the value of the currency should fall.  This is what is happening, and therefore the value of all assets that bring dollar returns will continue to fall.

 Gold production in the world in 2020 amounted to approximately 3.3 thousand tons, or about 1.5% of the total amount of precious metal mined in the entire history (about 200 thousand tons).  This means that the emission of this currency - gold - occurs at a rate of 1.5% per year, which is much lower than the average rate of emission of the dollar and euro over the past ten years (for example, 7% in dollars).  Therefore, we should expect that the rate of gold against the dollar and the euro will grow.

 Thirdly, no country in the world has a monopoly on the printing of this ancient currency.  The ""printing press"" for gold is the mining and metallurgical companies that mine it all over the world.  Therefore, no one will be able to use this currency as a geopolitical tool to put pressure on other states.

 This leads to a growing demand for gold from the central banks of countries that do not issue such reserve currencies as the dollar and euro.  Over the past ten years, the world's central banks have bought 15% of the world's gold production, and this trend can be expected to continue.

 By the way, in many ways, the properties listed above are also suitable for bitcoin - limited emission, lack of control over emission by any state, zero profitability - which makes bitcoin interesting for investors in a world with printing presses.

 What's next?

 The past 2020 has been a good year for gold, with prices up more than 20% over the year, which coincides with the difference between the increase in the dollar money supply and the increase in the gold supply.  At some point, the metal price was above $ 2 thousand per ounce, but now it is consolidating at $ 1.8-1.9 thousand, which may become a good entry point into the market for investors who missed this year's rally.

 2021 has every chance of becoming no worse than 2020.  In the last weeks of last year, the rise in inflation expectations resumed, and the strongly accelerated growth in commodity prices suggests that expectations will soon materialize in inflation statistics.

 At the same time, the rhetoric of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank suggests that interest rates will remain zero or negative, and monetary policy is soft for at least several years.  Therefore, it is likely that real rates will fall deeper into the negative zone, which will force investors to return to gold.

 Expectations are also positively affected by the continuing devaluation of the dollar, and the recovery of the global economy with the start of mass vaccination will lead to the recovery of another important component of demand for gold - the jewelry market.

 If in the first few months since the beginning of the pandemic, the demand for gold from the jewelry sector fell by 50% year-on-year, over the past few months it has been actively recovering and will continue to recover in 2021.  All these factors indicate that gold can continue its victorious march to $ 2.5-3 thousand per ounce in 2021-2022."|investing|Gold can continue its victorious march to $ 2.5-3 thousand per ounce in 2021-2022|16.0|0.7

The financial advisors that setup my employee retirement plans convinced me to get a Indexed Universal Life policy. After doing some research, and being slightly older and wiser, I am regretting that decision.

The advisor sold me on I “could diversify my portfolio” and “grow my investment tax free”. I do not need the insurance, it was simply pitched as a “well-to-do-man’s” investment vehicle.

The annual premium is $40k. I have invested $120k into the policy. Forgive me if I can’t get too technical because truthfully I don’t understand this policy (lesson #1 don’t invest in something you don’t understand). But honestly, from what I have read, most of the people selling policies like this don’t even understand it as it is a complex product.🙄

Originally the advisor told me I could contribute $40k for 5 years and then “he would reduce the benefit..?” so I didn’t have to put any more in, and the original 5 year investment would be enough to carry out the cost of the policy and give me X amount of money per year for the rest of my life after twenty years or something like that.

At this point I’m just trying to get some clarity on what I got myself into. How big of a scam is this? And what are my options to exit. Should I take the loss now? Year 5 surrender value is showing $50k on $200k invested. Can I count that $150k difference as a loss on my taxes?

My main worry with this product is I have seen people say the cost of insurance in this policy can rise and eventually eat away any value I contributed to it..?

I also wanted to post this to help other young investors who get into these situations. Honestly, I think you are better off putting your money in an index fund and using that as an “insurance” policy if your loved ones ever need cash. 

There will be some people who sell insurance that comment on this and say otherwise.. but the people who sell these policies are usually sharks and tug at your heart strings by saying “don’t you care about your family?” Feeling frustrated I got played but maybe someone else can learn from this.

There has been enough commentary about the conservative multiple so I will instead try to discuss the market dynamics and technology shifts. I hope this helps bring awareness to this segment of the market and look forward to a discussion around these points.

**Disclosure: I work in enterprise software and am long 10,100 shares @ $22 (**[screenshot](https://imgur.com/jqbb94X)**)**

**TLDR: In a future where an infinite amount of machine data is being generated, only Sumo has the architecture that makes sense.**

# Overview of the logging market

Let’s begin by understanding what logs are. All digital machines generate data, everything from status updates from a server, traffic levels on the network, battery levels of your phone, and even temperature readings from your HVAC system. The amount of machine data generated will continue to grow exponentially, particularly as more and more IoT devices come online (smartwatches, cars, fridges, etc.).

All of these logs need a central repository to be stored, upon which analysis can be performed. Historically logs have mostly been from on-prem systems like firewalls, routers, databases, etc. however as more and more systems migrate to the cloud, these new cloud environments are generating logs as well.

These logs are important to the IT organisation of any company, to be able to track and answer questions such as:

* How are traffic levels trending on my website?
* Is my AWS instance still alive? How is the application performing?
* Are my Windows machines patched and up to date?
* Is there any unusual activity on my network?

This culminates into a single pane of glass, where companies can monitor the health and status of all their systems in one place. In addition to that, large companies are mandated to store logs for:

* **Compliance:** Companies need to store immutable logs for a certain period of time as a form of record keeping.
* **Security:** Logs are reviewed during threat forensics after a cybersecurity breach. The security team needs to inspect their firewall/access logs to identify how and when they got breached. ie. who accessed this file and when?

As a result, we can expect the logging market to continue to exist over the long term. The only question is, **who is best positioned to meet this need for the future?**

# The current players

While there are many nuances and buzzwords around SIEM, observability, APM, IoT, etc. I will keep things simple and talk only about a relatively established and mature market – logging. It is a crowded market with a lot of players including LogRhythm, Loggly, Logz.io, Rapid7, IBM, Exabeam, etc. I will look specifically at the companies built for serving the Fortune 500, as this enterprise segment is where the greatest share of wallet is. Datadog deserves a mention, however their core competency is APM. Their log solution was through a startup acquisition and has a pretty negligible run-rate so we’ll ignore them in this discussion.

|Company|Founded|Type|Multitenant|Market Cap (as of 02/21)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ArcSight|2000|On-prem (1st gen)|No|Acquired|
|Splunk|2004|On-prem (2nd gen)|No|28B|
|Elastic|2012|Open Source|No|15B|
|Sumo Logic|2010|Cloud SaaS (1st gen)|Yes|4B|

The original pioneer of the logging market is ArcSight, who were then acquired by HP and subsequently spun off to Microfocus. They are now dying a slow death, while Splunk is the current de-facto solution for most companies.

A CIO today has 2 main choices when wanting to implement a logging solution, they can either Buy or Build.

1. **Buy:** Pay Splunk to help deploy in your datacentre. And then pay them professional service fees every year to help maintain and manage the software. And pay them based on the amount of data you send to them.
2. **Build:** Get a bunch of your developers to build a solution inhouse using an open source Elastic stack (ELK). They then have to actively manage the system themselves to keep it alive and manually scale it up and down accordingly.

# Architecture matters

**The shift from on-prem to cloud**

A lot of the latest high-flying SaaS companies haven’t really been that innovative. They are solving the same age-old problems, except doing it in the cloud instead. A few examples are shown below. In fact, a lot of these are done by the exact same people. Crowdstrike was founded by ex-McAfee guys, Zoom was founded by ex-Webex, and so on. No different with Sumo, which was founded by ex-ArcSight guys. The reason for this phenomenon is because these people understand their industry inside out and have experienced the challenges first-hand. They see where things are headed and want to do things a better way. Another common trend amongst all of these new hot stocks is that they were founded AFTER the inception of the cloud (AWS began in 2006).

The shift is both a technological one (on-prem -&gt; cloud) as well as a business model shift (license -&gt; SaaS). Sumo is in a similar position to capture this technology lifecycle shift, as workloads shift from on-prem to cloud. Naturally, logging and analysis should also occur in the cloud. This kind of scale is what the cloud was made for.

|Incumbent|Cloud SaaS|Market|
|:-|:-|:-|
|McAfee|Crowdstrike|Endpoint security|
|Siebel|Salesforce|CRM|
|Oracle|Workday|ERP|
|Webex|Zoom|Video conferencing|
|Remedy|ServiceNow|ITSM|

While Splunk no doubt has a more mature product that can serve a broader range of edge cases, Sumo has managed to demonstrate product maturity by gaining a client like Macquarie Bank, a bank in Australia (case study available on YouTube). Anyone who works in enterprise software sales knows that cracking the FSI vertical is the holy grail, as they are super conservative, with lots of red tape and requirements. It’s one thing to convince a forward-thinking cloud native company (like JFrog or PagerDuty) to use your software, it’s another thing to convince a bank to send their sacred data to a third-party cloud.

**A structural advantage: Multitenancy and Elasticity**

Given the volume heavy nature of this type of business, architecture really matters particularly as the amount of data grows exponentially. The advantage with multitenancy ultimately manifests itself either in the form of better gross margins, or reduced costs to customers.

We know that this is where the market is heading, not just because every other SaaS vendor is multitenant, but also because Splunk is throwing big dollars in trying to reposition for the cloud. Splunk doubled their R&amp;D budget, spending over $600m in R&amp;D alone last year, which is probably more than Sumo has spent in its entire lifetime. They are desperately trying to catch up, but multitenancy is not a feature you can add overnight, as it involves rearchitecting your entire product. It is especially hard when you already thousands of customers using your platform, it gets even harder once you’ve bolted on a few acquisitions over the years. It is akin to trying to convert a regular combustion car into an electric car, while someone is driving it.

It took a long time for Splunk just to achieve the basic separation of storage and compute, a milestone they achieved last year. This is what happens when you’re trying to refactor code written in 2004, and throwing 10x more money doesn’t necessarily accelerate things by 10x. Frank Slootman (Snowflake CEO) had a fairly eloquent way of describing this:

&gt;You can put 1000 mothers on the task of creating a baby, but it’ll still take 9 months.

Splunk Cloud in its current form is simply a hosted solution, meaning that instead of hosting the software yourself in your data centre, you’re paying Splunk (who pays AWS) to host it. This is very different from a true cloud native SaaS solution (which is what Sumo is).

# Asymmetric risk and incredible upside

**Massive TAM**

Sumo is backed by the crème de la crème of VCs: Accel, DFJ Growth, Greylock, IVP, Sequoia, Sutter Hill Ventures, Battery Ventures. Usually you see 1 or 2 of these names in any winning company, you almost never see all of them together. And even if you did, you definitely wouldn’t be able to get it at prices close to theirs. These people spend all day thinking about the future, TAM and competitive dynamics. And they allowed Sumo to make a big long term bet and spend 10 years developing the next generation platform. By putting their money where their mouth is, these people have validated the market and investment opportunity for you, and you’re able to participate in the upside at a price not too distant from theirs.

The last VC pricing round in May 2019 for Sumo was at $12 (\~3x). For comparison, Snowflake’s last VC price in February 2020 itself was $39, and they are now trading around $300 (\~8x). Typically, the majority of the gains are captured by the VCs pre-IPO, but in this case there is still plenty of room for retail investors to participate in the upside. Sumo is also barely scratching the surface with market penetration. Only 15% of their revenue is coming from outside the US, there is so much room for international expansion. Mature software companies usually see around 50% of their revenue from international sources.

**Multiple Expansion**

Prior to COVID, Sumo had a pretty solid and consistent growth rate. It doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect it could revert to the mean and get back closer to 50% once the macroeconomic outlook improves. There are many notable growth companies that have missed a couple of quarters, I remember when ZScaler had a quarter with 18% billings growth and the stock tanked, presenting an incredible buying opportunity for those who believed in the long-term vision and market opportunity, rather than quarter to quarter execution. Similarly in 2010, people back then were debating whether Apple’s stock was overpriced, based on whether they were going to sell 8m or 10m phones that quarter, which in hindsight seems a little silly and didn’t really matter.

**Sumo Revenue Growth Rates:**

* FY2019: 53%
* FY2020: 50%
* FY2021E: 30% (COVID)
* FY2022 and beyond: ???

If Sumo can get back closer to 50% growth rates, the stock could see significant multiple expansion. For perspective, other SaaS companies at 50% growth rates are currently trading closer to a 40x multiple, which would put Sumo closer to a valuation in the 12B range (roughly $120 share price). In addition, the risk reward here is asymmetric, given they are already priced in for a low growth rate. Meaning that if they do deliver a low growth rate, nothing much will happen and the downside is limited. Whereas if they manage to execute, deliver positive surprise during earnings and become the cloud leader for logs, the upside is incredible.

In the current rate environment and frothiness within software stocks, it is not unreasonable to expect that their market cap could easily go from 4B -&gt; 40B within 3 years. What we have is a company that was good enough to go public during a pandemic, but was conservatively priced due to the short-term execution issues. While Sumo has had weak execution over the past 12 months, they are well positioned for the future due to the architecture they’ve spent 10 years building. In investing you want to spend more time thinking about what the future could bring, rather than what happened the past 2 quarters.

# So why has the stock been floundering?

This is what I have been asking myself ever since the flopped IPO. In addition to the growth deceleration causing multiple compression, I think the real challenge Sumo has faced is that they may have been too early to the market. It wouldn’t be the first time that VCs were too forward thinking, the reality is that these large companies are relatively slow moving and trends take a long time to play out. Even across the broader cloud story, we are still in the very early innings.

More specifically, Sumo has been struggling with:

* Inability to acquire net new customers
* Competing against vendors with much larger scale
* A less than articulate CEO. Granted he came from a product background as opposed to a sales background, so we’ll cut him some slack. I originally thought he seemed a little burnt out but having watched his older videos, that’s just the way he is.

As they say, you want to be either the number 1 or 2 in any market. Sumo is not that (but has the potential to be).

# The bottom line

**Splunk is slipping**

When your marketing team is busy pushing t-shirts, that’s how you know you’ve hit rock bottom and really have nothing good to talk about. It is also evident that Splunk has become a bureaucratic political beast. Their cloud team has had a different leader every 2-3 years. With those kinds of dynamics, it is very difficult to execute on a long-term vision and see the development through. Execs get paid on short term quarterly performance, and nobody wants to risk cannibalising their cash cow. There has also recently been a massive exodus within their sales team, which began with their CRO leaving, and this is usually a leading indicator that the party is over.

**Elastic is a wildcard**

The wildcard here is Elastic, as they have demonstrated product market fit and strong momentum within the developer community. They have been taking share from Splunk and may end up becoming the provider of choice, instead of Sumo. However if you zoom out, the idea of every company building and managing their own log solution just seems silly. This simply isn’t the way software was meant to be built, particularly since logging a common requirement across companies, and the devices generating these logs are also the same.

**A better way to do things**

My view is that any software that requires the buyer to maintain it, is garbage software. This is the case with Splunk and ArcSight where customers have to pay professional service fees every year for consultants to tweak and maintain it. And it’s the same case with Elastic which requires you to provision a team of people on keeping the system alive. With Sumo it’s pretty straight forward, you install connectors which route the logs into Sumo. From there Sumo processes the data and generates dashboards, etc.

**Watch out for Q4 earnings in March**

The most important thing obviously is that Sumo can actually deliver on the vision. A few important things are happening next month when they announce earnings, here are some things to watch:

* Q4 growth performance – is the chart moving up and to the right?
* FY2022 guidance – how healthy is their pipeline looking?
* Lockup comes off – are VCs dumping the stock?

Sumo needs to demonstrate a reacceleration in growth, and to signal confidence in the future. If they can guide &gt;30% growth for FY2022, then a 10 bagger within 3 years is in sight. Any less than that and it deserves to trade like a donkey. Trade it if you want to bet on positive surprise next quarter, hold it if you believe in the long-term vision.

**Final thoughts**

I think that companies are going to move from Splunk -&gt; Sumo when they get sick of getting ripped off, and as more of their workloads shift to the cloud. I think that companies are going to move from Elastic -&gt; Sumo, when they get sick of needing to manage a solution, or when it gets too complex. I think that at the end of the day all markets experience margin compression and get commoditised, and that Sumo has a cost advantage due to their architecture. Only a true cloud native, multi-tenant SaaS platform makes sense for a world generating an infinite amount of data.

&gt;**Does return on equity consistently exceed 10% without the use of heavy leverage?**  
&gt;  
&gt;The  average return on equity has been 29% over the last 10 years. This is  aided by leverage, but it is primarily driven by the pricing power of  the business. ROIC has averaged 29% over the last 10 years, as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Is management sketchy?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Management  is transparent and honest. The CEO, Hal Lawton, is an excellent choice  with a strong track record at eBay, Home Depot, and Macy’s. Management  has been consistently honest and transparent. Management’s track record  of strong growth and high returns on capital also shows that they are  competent. They pass my easy hurdle of “not being sketchy” and go far  beyond that. They strike me as excellent managers of the company and  stewards of shareholder interests.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Is the company financially healthy?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Debt/equity  is high, but the company is still in a position of strong financial  strength. The Altman Z-Score is 5.2 and the interest coverage is 35.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Has the company consistently generated returns for shareholders? Is the industry in secular decline?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Tractor  Supply has generated excellent returns for shareholders. It has  delivered a 27% CAGR since 2000. This is not a “buggy whip” company that  is in secular decline. They have a strong relationship with their  customers &amp; a geographic/cultural niche. I don’t think this is  easily disrupted by a competitor or technological change.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Has the company survived previous recessions?**  
&gt;  
&gt;The  company remained profitable through the GFC. Operating profit declined  for one year (2008) when it declined from $160 million to $136 million.  It didn’t report a loss and weathered this storm well. By 2009, the  company posted a then-record $192 million in operating profit. They have  not posted an annual EPS loss in the last 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Does the company have a moat?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Tractor  Supply has a moat. The moat is derived from its niche. It builds its  stores close to its rural customers and supplies them with niche  products. This gives them an edge with these customers over more  generalized retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, or Petsmart. It seems  unlikely to me that a competitor will invade TSCO’s turf and try to  disrupt it.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Pass.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Is the stock cheap on an absolute and relative basis?**  
&gt;  
&gt;From  a free cash yield and shareholder yield basis, the company is fairly  valued. Most of its multiples are in the higher range of the stock’s  history. The price isn’t absurd, and it seems reasonable if one expects  the high rate of growth to continue into the future. However, I don’t  like to count on a 20% EPS growth rate to continue. I would not describe  this as “cheap,” or a wonderful price. I would rather remain patient  for the company to trade at a more attractive price.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Fail**.  
&gt;  
&gt;**If I was forced to hold the stock for 10 years, would I be comfortable?**  
&gt;  
&gt;I  would not be terrified to hold the stock for 10 years. They have a  strong moat and I think they are unlikely to be disrupted. However, I  think that multiple compression is likely from these levels and the  stock could suffer a significant drawdown if the economy entered a  difficult period. Based on the valuation, I wouldn’t be comfortable  holding this 10 years without the ability to sell.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Fail.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Conclusion:  I am passing on this stock for valuation alone. It doesn’t strike me as  a wonderful price. However, it’s on my crash wishlist of wonderful  companies if Mr. Market ever decides to offer it up at a bargain price.  It trades in a reasonable enough area right now where I think it would  become extremely attractive if the larger market took a dive.**

It’s not a question of if we’ll see a correction – it’s a matter of *when.*

The US stock market has seen astronomical growth since March 2020 when the S&amp;P 500 tanked 30% due to COVID-19. **The level of growth we have seen is unprecedented and unsustainable.**

The technology sector is what experienced the majority of this growth. Nearly every major technology company on NASDAQ is at all time high levels.

Low interest rates and even negative interest rates have caused the bond market to dry up. Investors are moving their funds into the stock market where they can still earn a positive return.

We have also seen a significant flow of capital into the market from retail investors thanks to the increasing popularity of commission-free platforms.

We do not insist on liquidating positions, but rather to proceed with caution.

Consider allocating a decent proportion of your holdings into defensive companies – companies that produce products or services that will always be in demand and will be less impacted when capital flows out of the stock market and back into the bond market when interest rates inevitably rise – given the current economic situation this will likely be a while.

**Consider increasing your proportion of dividend-generating equities.**

When will interest rates rise? When unemployment is at reasonable levels and the world starts recovering from COVID-19. When will this happen? Your guess is as good as ours, but it will eventually happen, so prepare for it.

So OCGN stock soared about 180% in the past 5 days due to their recent deal with Bharat Biotech to potentially bring Covaxin, a COVID-19 vaccine to the US market. The first news about the potential collaboration surfaced around second week of December 2020. Their market cap rose from 50.23M on November 30th to 850M to Friday closing.  It is not clear if they have to conduct trials here in US and if they will get an emergency use authorization. Other than Covaxin partnership  they are working on gene therapy based treatments for retinal diseases, all in pre-clinical phase (not profitable yet). I'm trying to make sense of their valuation, if is it sensible even if everything works out favorably for Ocugen?

* Ocugen will share 45% share of potential profits and can only sale Covaxin within US. 
* Covaxin is priced at about 400 Rupees (5.5 USD) per dose.  So Ocugen's profit share could be $3
* Even if they get about 1/3rd of the US market share that's about 330M (110\*3)
* Again this might not be a recurring source of income for them as it is not clear if we need to get vaccinated for COVID annually and they cannot sell outside US
* So isn't the potential upside already factored in their stock price? I have seen many people claim that they can reach 20, 50 and even 100 if they get an emergency use authorization to use Covaxin in US. Am I completely missing something here?"|investing|Ocugen hype and valuation|22.0|0.83

At the end of the day it is my money and I will weigh all of my options and make what I feel is the best investment. I'm reading and watching video tutorials on how to do both technical and fundamental analysis.  So here goes:  


CLNE - With the current administration there is buzz around clean energy. Looking at the chart, I kind of feel like I missed the party on this one.

RYCEY - Rolls royce has been around for a long time. Apparently they're planning a two week shutdown to help cut losses. But do we think that they will bounce back towards the end of the year? As the vaccine rolls out and people start traveling again for summer and the holidays, will their air plain maintenance services get busy again? Will they need to be bailed out?

SNDL - I really know nothing about weed stocks.  I just know that people have been doing very well with them as of late.

Its really hard to tell if Canoo is a good long term investment, id imagine alot of EV companies will be wiped out as the market matures over the next couple years. In the short term they have gotten some good news, but thats not what this post is about.

$GOEV is, as far as i can tell, caught in a large Symmetric Triangle pattern. With a difference between the top and bottom of the pattern at its start  \~ $10. Given $GEOV is currently trading at 17.63, this would represent over half of the stocks total value. If the stock trends upward coming out of the pattern that would mean a target price of 27-28 dollars and nice profit on some rampant speculation. I consider this fairly risky and not recommend anyone actually attempt it.

However, something I have never invested in before ,Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPs), caught my attention. They have been providing nice returns over the last 2-3 years and the volatility is small compared to stocks. 

* The main reason for TIPs to go higher over the next \~5 years is US demographics (just look at  the US population pyramid). Large portion of US population is close to retirement ,and gradually their investments will be pushed more into safer asset classes (bonds). This is especially true due to large target date funds and other passive investment vehicles which automatically re-balance investor's portfolio based on their age
* For existing bond holders, TIPs are better option than just bonds because they also protect again inflation (due to stimulus packages, money being printed like crazy)
* In case of gradual stock market correction, TIPs will be one of the safety assets for preservation of capital (stock market over valuation is disputable) 
* On another note, rising interest rates could drive TIPs to go down

With that said, $CTYX is going to fucking Pluto 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🌑

**Price Target: $0.5 by May 1, 2021; $1.25 - $3.00 (\~10x) within 2 years with credible potential to be listed on NASDAQ.**

This company is absolutely solid on all sides: healthy financials, an experienced &amp; reliable management team, favorable market conditions with a reasonable business model, a solid lineup of products in its pipeline, and many large announcements anticipated within the next 3 months. Simply put, there is extreme asymmetric upside.

$CTYX or Connectyx was taken over by its current team led by CEO Paul Michaels around Feb 2020. Within a year, this CEO has kept every promise he's made and established the infrastructure for growth. The company specializes in bringing orphan drugs (more on this below) through clinical trials and then to market. Paul and his team have decades of experience in big pharma, biotech research, finance, and drug licensing/development (in-depth description in the Management Team section below). They've vetted 3 promising drug candidates in under a year and promised to start clinical trials by mid-2022. If any one of these pass phase 1/2 trials, the market cap grows by hundreds of millions. They also have a reasonable chance to obtain a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) from the FDA that is worth $100-$300M from their strategic picks. They have a clean balance sheet, acquired non-dilute bridge financing while putting these drugs through trials, and have plans of additional deals in the near future.

Why orphan drugs? Orphan drugs are therapeutics that treat rare diseases (defined as illnesses affecting less than 200k Americans per year). From the \[Orphan Drug Act\]([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orphan\_Drug\_Act\_of\_1983#:\~:text=The Orphan Drug Act of,residing in the United States.)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983#:~:text=The%20Orphan%20Drug%20Act%20of,residing%20in%20the%20United%20States.)), there are multiple incentives given by the government to develop orphan drugs: (1) significant tax credits (2) longer market exclusivity after approval (3) waiver of certain FDA fees (4) easier &amp; faster approval process. In 2019, the global orphan drug market is estimated to be valued at $151B. By 2027, this is projected to reach [$340.84B](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/orphan-drugs-market-100088) (10% compounded annual growth). This the cornerstone of their [business model](https://connectyx.com/about-us/). By gathering a group of experts, they can cheaply vet high potential candidates to add to their development pipeline and then commercialize them from reduced fees as well as fast-track benefits from the FDA.

So why the hell is it call Connectyx? It is just the old name of a software services company which the team acquired. The company has filed for a name change that will be granted within the next 2 weeks to Curative Biotechnology Inc. with a new ticker $CURB. In addition, the CEO himself has hinted at an uplisting to $OTCQB (a certification upgrade from current pink sheet status), merger/acquisition announcements, and $100M in non-dilutive funding. The official FINRA announcement of the name change will be the catalyst for the additional news.

Some quick notes about the charts. The 15x jump in the past couple of months is only the beginning. There is a clear trend of resistance breakthroughs and medium-term consolidation after each announcement. Volatility is low, the number of outstanding shares is small, and there is limited dilutive potential for an OTC.

Let's dive deeper into this hidden gem.

All-Star Management Team

**CEO Paul Michaels**

Curative BioTech lucked out with a CEO with 25 years of experience in investment banking with a focus on life sciences. Paul has an impressive record, starting as the Executive Vice President and board member of [Global Capital Group](https://gcgam.com/) (a Wall Street wealth management firm). He also got extensive experience in big Pharma through \[Inabata &amp; Co. Ltd's\]([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Inabata\_%26\_Co.,\_Ltd.)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Inabata_%26_Co.,_Ltd.)), a subsidiary of a large Japanese drug company, [Sumitomo Chemical Group](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sumitomo_Chemical), which totaled $21.8B in revenue in 2013 and employs over 30k people. While serving as Inabata's CFO, Paul licensed American drugs (some from Gilead) for the Asian market. After, the guy helped create [Nobelpharma](https://www.nobelpharma.co.jp/en/), an orphan drug company, which licenses drugs for rare diseases and got over $35M in initial capital.

In February 2020, Paul took over Connectyx (a software services company at the time) and made it an orphan drug company. It is extremely rare for pink-sheet companies to have such high-caliber, established talent as a leader: decades of experience with finance and leadership positions in multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies. He helped build up Inabata and Nobelpharam (both thriving today), and I am confident in his ability to do it again with Connectyx.

Robust Drug Pipeline

Keep in mind this company became a biotech firm in Feb 2020 and they already have 3 drugs in the pipeline along with exclusive rights licenses. Insane.

**1) IMT504 immune therapy to treat late-stage rabies.**

(11/23/2020 Announcement implies IMT504 rabies license deal is complete)

[Strategic relationship](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/connectyx-technologies-holdings-group-inc-announces-strategic-relationship-with-mid-atlantic-biotherapeutics-inc-for-treatment-of-symptomatic-rabies-1029540377) with Mid-Atlantic BioTherapeutics, Inc. announced on 8/27/2020. Acquired all rights for development of this patented immunotherapy to treat late-stage rabies (a disease with 100% fatality rate after the treatable period, \[kills 59k\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613553/#:\~:text=about this topic%3F-,Each year%2C rabies causes approximately 59%2C000 deaths worldwide%2C including approximately,of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP).)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613553/#:~:text=about%20this%20topic%3F-,Each%20year%2C%20rabies%20causes%20approximately%2059%2C000%20deaths%20worldwide%2C%20including%20approximately,of%20postexposure%20prophylaxis%20(PEP).)) globally per year).

Now, the value of this may not be in the drug approval itself (although passing trials would be a huge asset of course). The value is the potential in CTYX obtaining a [Priority Review Voucher](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Priority_review#/Priority_review_voucher_program) (PRV). These coupons are handed out by the FDA each year to incentivize research into rare diseases. Exercising the coupon means diminishing the approval process from 10 months to 6 after trials. Further, you can freely sell these on a secondary market to other companies! Historically, these have been sold between $100M to $300M each. If obtained, this is an instant 2x-6x increase to its current $50M market cap. There's more.. notice that the FDA has added Rabies to its PRV-eligible tropical diseases list. Currently, there is only a handful of rabies therapies being researched. This means there's actually a good chance of CYTX getting rewarded a voucher, despite the relatively low count of vouchers distributed annually. PRVs are also possible for all other drugs in the pipeline.

**2) CURB906 monoclonal antibody cytotoxic conjugate for the treatment of Glioblastoma.**

(10/16/2020 NIH gives a grant of license for worldwide rights)

The [second license](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/connectyx-in-licensing-discussions-for-novel-monoclonal-antibody-to-treat-pediatric-glioblastoma-1029369107) was filed near July 2020 for a novel monoclonal antibody conjugate to treat brain cancer. Glioblastomas are aggressive brain tumors with poor survival rates in children. Recent studies (e.g. [s1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28675164/), [s2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrclinonc.2017.95?WT.feed_name=subjects_neurology)) have shown different combinations of chemo-therapy and antibody-drug conjugate (ADCs) therapeutics were effective in both mice and human models. ADCs are innovative methods that attach a cytotoxic compound (one meant to kill cancer cells) to an antibody that specifically attaches to certain cancer cell receptors, thus delivering therapies to their targets. There is great promise and lots of potential in these therapeutics. Exclusive Evaluation and Commercialization Option License Agreement with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has been granted.

**3) Metformin repurposed to treat retinal degeneration.**

(2/4/2021 NIH gives a grant of license for worldwide rights)

This is probably the ace in the hole and the largest reason behind the recent stock surge. On 2/4/2021, CTYX [announced](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/connectyx-announces-grant-of-exclusive-worldwide-license-from-national-institutes-of-health-for-repurposing-metformin-to-treat-degenerative-eye-disease-1030044728) they received an NIH grant for exclusive worldwide rights to adapt a diabetes drug, Metformin, to treat retinal degeneration. Not only is Metformin proven safe (it is a widely used drug to treat Type1 Diabetes since 1995), there are many studies (e.g. [s1](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2731001), [s2](https://techtransfer.cancer.gov/availabletechnologies/e-227-2018), [s3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32525055/)) that hint at its effectiveness for retinal diseases. The recently granted license not only covers pediatric retinal generation (in the form of [Stargardt Disease](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stargardt_disease)), it covers treatment in adults as well and includes macular degeneration. This promising treatment potentially covers 2/3 of the US population (2/3 of Americans are pre-diabetic, 1/10 are diabetic, and 11 million have some form of macular degeneration; why care about diabetes? diabetes causes retinopathy).

Huge Upcoming Announcements

The announced name change is the opening of the flood gates for all upcoming news. Additional licenses, uplistings, and deals with be done under the new company name. Expect many of these announcements following FINRA approval. These are some forward-looking implications:

1. (Within 2 weeks) FINRA approval of name change to Curative Biotechnology Inc. and ticker $CURB.
2. (Within weeks of name change) Following the name change, there will be an uplisting to OTCQB. [OTCQB](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/otcqx-vs-otcqb-vs-pink-171211773.html) is a tier up from Pink Sheets and must adhere to stricter management certifications, undergo annual audits, and are more stringent in their financial reporting. Connectyx is currently working to become fully reporting OTCQB; to that end, the Company appointed Jonathan D. Leinwand, PA as Legal Counsel.
3. (Within weeks of name change) Talk of multiple upcoming drugs (if the Metformin announcement was one of them, we should see at least one more).
4. (Within weeks of name change) Hints at $100M of non-dilutive funding for clinical trials.
5. (Within months of name change) Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships with other firms for licensing and commercialization.

Downsides

Before we get ahead of ourselves and dream about retiring in 3 months while riding this into space, we gotta ground ourselves and discuss the downsides. Remember: in life, there are no solutions, only tradeoffs. There are always downsides and risks.

Risk 1) This is currently a pink sheet. That itself should make you more cautious because there is reduced regulation, more ""flexible"" rules, and less scrutiny/transparency.

Risk 2) High risk, high reward. If all 3 drugs flop (assuming no additional therapeutics are added) and they don't get a PRV (priority review voucher), then this company is worthless. Granted, the chances are low, but still a possibility to consider.

Risk 3) Share dilution and raising capital. Because clinical trials often require obscene amounts of capital (\~$400M investment for normal drugs), there is a risk that managers might dilute the stock in order to raise money or to take profits in general. There are currently 322M outstanding shares with 1.1B authorized shares. Read the share disclosures, do the math, gauge the risks. Note that orphan drug trials are a lot less costly as well.

Risks and unknowns are certainly there. However, the upside potential is too big to ignore. Buy at pennies, sell for dollars. Do the research and take advantage of any dips that might come on Monday from 2 days of green explosions.

\------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR.

* You should fucking read it, because this Phoenix has a high probability of rising from ashes to become the OTC stock of the year/decade with effortless 10x upside in the short-term.
* $CTYX will change to $CURB (Curative BioTech) soon. Business strategy: (1) bring together financial experts, veterans in big pharma, accomplished biotech researchers, and world-class grant writers to vet orphan drugs (2) make deals and obtain licenses for these drugs to help get them through clinical trials (3) take advantage of special FDA benefits for orphan drug approval (faster approval process, fee waivers, etc) and commercialize them after with longer exclusive rights.
* **Finance**: company has no problematic debt, clean sheets, non-dilutive funding, and a small number of outstanding shares for an OTC (322M).
* **Products**: 3 promising drug candidates in the pipeline within a year. Multiple exclusive license grants approved by the NIH.
* **Upcoming Announcements**: (1) name change (2) uplisting to $OTCQB from pink sheets (3) more non-dilutive funding (4) additional drug(s) in pipeline (5) mergers, acquisitions, and deals with other pharma companies.
* Current market cap: $50M. **Upside**: (1) +$100M - $300M if awarded a priority review voucher (PRV) (2) +hundreds of millions in market cap if any of the 3 promising drugs goes past phase 2 \~end of 2022 (3) +millions in speculative capital if new drugs are announced in pipeline (4) potential future merger with large pharma or uplisting to NASDAQ (other biotech companies are listed with half the number of products).

So I’d like to try my hand at building a portfolio based on the Fama-French model. I’ll primarily focus on size (market cap), value (pe ratio, price/book ratio, etc) and quality. I will largely ignore momentum as a factor since it requires too much active management. My problem is that I don’t really understand the quality factor except that it appears to relate to profitability. Can anyone help me understand the most effective way to screen for quality in stocks?

If I look at Apple, its PE ratio is 37 &amp; PB ratio is 34. To me this sounds like an unusual case. A very high PB ratio indicates that the current price of a stock is high (very high in this case) compared to its book value. However, Apple's PE ratio is not insanely high at the same price.

This means that Apple is able to generate a lot of revenue &amp; profits with fewer assets that make up book value. Would this inference be correct? If yes, does this somehow pose a problem for Apple's business in future?

It’s always more risky to buy a company before their product is approved. Risk-adverse investors may wish to wait for the headline. Investors with risk tolerance have one week to accumulate before the official deadline, but may find that the decision comes early.

G1 has two drugs in its pipeline
1. Trilaciclib
2. Rintodestrant

Trilaciclib works by preserving healthy cells during chemotherapy. This upcoming decision is centered around small cell lung cancer, but is generally considered the doorway for all other cancers that need chemotherapy. G1 hopes to make Trilaciclib the standard of care for cancer patients by 2025, which would substantially raise their value along the way.

Rintodestrant, by comparison, is a much less lofty opportunity. It is aiming to address a specific type of breast cancer. Although it is less exciting, it could be another near-term win that helps with profitability.

Needham’s analyst, Chad Messer, believes that positive results for both drugs this year could lead to $74 per share. Looking longer-term, Israel Englander, the man who turned $35 million into $40 billion with his savvy picks, revealed his fund accumulated 555,937 shares in a recent 13F filing.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

I'll cover many things that I think will be generally beneficial for newer traders and investors first, but if you're just looking for my current observations on GME, write about it and the end, so feel free to skip the wall of text in the middle if that's what you're here for :).

One thing I would suggest for newer traders, particularly following the Robin Hood fiasco, is to transition to a more powerful broker/platform.  As I've mentioned a few times, I use TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim platform (see very recent review [here](https://www.stockbrokers.com/review/tdameritrade)).  They don't pay me to promote it or anything, other than that I can say that my portfolio performance has been greatly enhanced by the capabilities the thinkorswim platform provides.

I've gotten many questions and comments requesting guidance on educational materials.  I haven't responded because I am honestly not the best person to ask about that.  I will say that the resources listed in this sub (to the right of the list of posts) look to be fairly comprehensive and excellent in quality.

# Awareness, Ideas, Thesis, Due Diligence

Most common question I got since my last post about my process for identifying trading and investing opportunities.

At a high level, it all starts with awareness and various ideas about how the world around us is likely to change, and what the market currently anticipates (you will commonly hear phrases like 'X is already priced in', or 'the market is already discounting the fact that', etc.).

Regarding GME, the idea I had was that some struggling retail and other businesses, which had been left for dead by the market, would actually rebound fairly quickly, and perhaps benefit from pent-up demand as the vaccines rolled out.

Ok, that makes sense, but how, in fact, do you take your awareness of the world, take some of those ideas, and actually do something with them?

I tend to start with running a screen (screen as in a sieve, not screen as in what you're staring at right now) in thinkorswim.  Other platforms have similar tools.  [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) is also excellent for a web-based tool.  These allow you to filter stocks by various types of criteria.

As an example, I might start by filtering for:

* Stocks in the retail sector
* Market cap &gt;65mio, &lt;3bn (I find that to be a good range for minimally stable micro cap to smaller mid-cap that is likely insufficiently covered by analysts, and therefore more likely to be substantially mis-rated by the broader market)
* PE &lt; 7 (nothing magic about 7, that's just what I decided to use as a relatively but not ridiculously low PE multiple)
* Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio &gt;1 (i.e. they can cover fixed costs out of earnings, so imminent bankruptcy risk is likely lower).  Note that if you're looking ultra deep value you might actually specifically want to find companies at risk of bankruptcy at first glance, to dig through in detail to find ones that look more likely to turn themselves around from the brink for some reason.

Etc.  It takes longer to think about what kinds of filters to use than anything else.  Once I've set those criteria up, you just run the scan (click a button in thinkorswim) and out pops a list of stocks that match the criteria in less than second.  On 2/6/2021 running the above scan gives me 9 names (of which, funny enough, Express--apparently another meme stock short squeeze play based on just looking at its chart for 2 seconds--is one).  For those who are curious, the list I got was: ANF (Abercombie &amp; Fitch), GES (Guess Inc), PLCE (children's Place), DBI (Designer Brands inc), GCO (Genesco), CAL (Caleres Inc), CHS (Chico's FAS INC), CATO (Cato Corp), EXPR (Express Inc)

At that point I might quickly check the charts to see what the daily action has been like for the past year, looking for patterns that might be interesting.  I'll pick PLCE for this example, since it is breaking out strongly, and looks to be about to smash through resistance of the price on the eve of the pandemic crash.  It also apparently blew out its last earnings estimates, which doesn't hurt.

At this point I might proceed to check their SEC filings (lots of insider buying a few days ago, Blackrock increasing stake, recently new CFO, etc.), whale wisdom, company news etc.  I found an [interesting article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/childrens-place-other-retailers-catch-133301579.html) from earlier last year that seems particularly positive--they have apparently been a leader in the retail sector in developing their digital omnichannel, with a large and foresighted investment made over 3 years ago, which made them particularly well-positioned to deal with the challenges of the pandemic (at least as far as bricks and mortar retail goes) and indicates very good things about the strategic vision of their management team and board.

It was a ridiculous bargain in November, but may still have room to run even today.  Not an endorsement or telling you to go buy some of the stock, but that's my quick read.

With the above 30 minutes of research done, I might make the decision that it warrants further investigation.

As you dig deeper, you start to build a working thesis or theory on how the company is going to deliver performance, or get enough attention from the investment community to warrant a re-rating outsized gains in share price (the bull case).  Then you try to find all the reasons and evidence as to why that isn't going to happen (the bear case).

From that point on you iterate as many times as seems prudent to you, depending on how much of your portfolio you intend to invest.  Since we're all here already, summarizing and posting your due diligence to this sub seems like a no-brainer.  It is very likely you'll get good feedback to help you refine your thesis even further, or perhaps stop you from making what might be a big mistake.

Even if I decide not to make an investment at the moment, at the very least I might add that stock to a watch list, etc.  I can actually set thinkorswim to give me an alert if any new companies pop up that match those criteria from now on.  This type of feature is pretty common with screening tools.  This might happen if, for example, a struggling retailer gets its cash flow in order and crosses from &lt;1 FCCR to &gt;1 FCCR.

A process very much like the above is how I found GME to begin with, and subsequently found my way to Reddit since there was so much GME-related traffic.

The Market is so much bigger than GME, so I highly encourage you to use the knowledge, tools, and techniques you've learned about or been exposed to to explore that bigger picture.

# You, The Market, The Trade

If you've found something that looks interesting enough to warrant actually investing, it's worth spending some time to further think about precisely how you think you should do so before you just hit the buy button.

If your thesis and time horizon are longer-dated, then stocks are likely your best bet.

If instead you have a very specific time window in which you're interested, or have reason to believe the stock will move by a certain date, then options might be much more capital-efficient with a higher return (though a much higher risk of greater or total losses as well).

There are many ways to express your ideas or bet on your thesis.  In fact, your thesis about a particular company might lead to trades on an entirely different company.  If your due diligence on a key industrial company that primarily supplies parts to a certain car company shows major investment in technology and production efficiency, that might also bode well for their customer, and thus warrant an investment there as well or instead.  My DD on oil storage capacity getting full back in April led to me taking some speculative positions in oil tanker stocks, as another example.

You may also modify the way you position your trade based on market conditions.  Jon Najarian (a CNBC regular who focuses on options trading) recently described how he is transitioning his portfolio using a stock replacement strategy.  This means using various options strategies to try to mimic the performance of stocks, but without holding stocks directly.  The reason for this is that he is increasingly concerned that we may have a large market correction in the near term, and would like to have a defined limit to potential losses (a feature of many options strategies).  I don't know if he's correct, but his moves make sense as a way to address his concerns.

Another thing I've referenced a few times in my post is writing cash-covered puts to essentially bet against the price falling vs betting that the price is going to rise.  This comes with the added wrinkle that 'losing' (i.e. the stock price in fact falls below the strike price of the put) comes with the added feature that you end up owning stock.  For this reason I commonly use this as a strategy on high-confidence stocks as a way to gain some revenue if the price goes higher, and effectively buy the dip if it goes down first.

How you express your thesis in terms of the specific trades you make can greatly impact the likelihood and magnitude of your returns, and the profile of your risk.  Buying the stock you like, while straightforward and with a very intuitive risk/reward profile, may not be the best way forward.

That being said, it is critical that you do understand the trade before you execute, so I would highly recommend practicing via paper/simulated trading--which, by the way, is a built-in feature of thinkorswim--before you execute a complex multi-leg option play.  Ok, I'll stop shilling for the rest of this post at least :).

# Back to GME

On Thursday and Friday what I believe we saw was despair-driven selling compounded by the tug of war between shorts that entered at $150+, and shorts still piling into the trade.

Overall short-side sentiment is more cautious at this point than at the highs despite supposed sentiment among short-side players that GME is a $10 ($20 at best) stock.  This is reflected in Ortex data showing utilization dropping below 100% for the first time in months (i.e. shorts are no longer borrowing every single share they can get their hands on), and short interest stabilizing over the past few days.  As of Thursday utilization was 69.3%, and free float on loan was at 44.1%. Data for Friday should become available just before Monday market open.

The reason for the above, I believe, is that while shorts seem to believe current prices are still a good entry point, they need to be concerned about getting blown up if a short that entered at the squeeze highs decides to cover and lock in profits.  The removal of restrictions on GME by Robin Hood adds another element of risk.

The lower the price, the likelier that deeply profitable shorts cover, spiking price while doing so at the expense of the newest shorts, and the easier it is for retail sentiment to move price, so we're in a sort of very fragile equilibrium until the larger shorts that entered at the higher price points have covered.

I'm not sure how to estimate when this would be, other than to say that the lower the price goes, and the more days that pass, the lower the incremental profit potential and higher accumulated interest cost for the short position holders, so I don't expect them to hold those squeeze high short positions for very long.  It is possible that the spike on Friday was a push to cover a fair bit of those positions before the weekend.  I would also expect that they will move to cover if somehow momentum seems to turn to the long side, which would accentuate and accelerate the the inflection of momentum greatly.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my last 130 shares of GME at this point.  It's possible I hold them for a while to watch how things play out for the next few weeks, but I wanted to give everyone reading my post fair warning that going forward I may make an intra-day decision to sell part of all of the position.  I will, however, keep open the cash-secured put position, as an automatic entry back into GME at an effective $30 price point if the price is &lt;$40 by April.  I may open new positions based on developments as well.

On a different note, I took some time to once again review my thoughts and decisions over the course of the trade.  While doing so I was reading back through my posts from 12 days ago (only 12!?  feels like it's been at least 3 weeks...) reminding me that I had previously begun building a position in [AMC as a value play](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4j5y0/amc_short_squeeze_potiential/gkotklz/?context=3) (via a couple of march $3 strike calls) on rumors of imminent rescue/turnaround financing.  I was originally planning to build a better position once I had time to study the potential trade structure better, but instead unloaded them at \~1000% profit for a net \~$2000 gain to concentrate further on GME when I was re-positioning my portfolio, not even realizing at the time that AMC was another stock with a legitimate short squeeze momentum thesis (LOL, I really should pay more attention to social media).  I just glossed over the profit as about what I was expecting off the bounce from market rerating the stock from ""bankruptcy is imminent"" to ""holy cr\*p, the studios need AMC for their movies to make money!"".  I should have realized when I was getting so many messages from people asking me to do for AMC what I was writing for GME.  I didn't even do any DD on the short interest there(!) and ignorantly advised people that they should only pay attention to the value thesis as I [channeled my inner Charlie Munger](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l4j5y0/amc_short_squeeze_potiential/gkp2b73/?context=3).

I guess it just goes to show that you only have time to look so far into so many things at once.  As I've mentioned previously, trading is a hobby of mine, and something I do in my spare time.  I'm not sure if I would have been able to coherently manage momentum trading two stocks that were basically printing money in overdrive at the same time to take full advantage of either trade, especially while writing daily posts.  Try to keep that in mind if you choose to pay attention to what I write :).

Also, apologies if you've messaged me and haven't gotten a response.  I will sometimes try to respond if I have time (and a good answer), but if you have a good question it would probably be better to either post as a comment or your own post so that you can get a broader range of responses, and also so that the responses can be seen by (and therefore benefit) everyone.

At one point analysts believed AMZN was overvalued at a 30 bn market cap, TSLA at 80 bn, and SQ at 20 bn. Because they just looked at the balance sheet and not the CEO of the company.

I also think people are making the same mistake with LMND. People are scratching their heads, at the current valuation and why shorting the company doesn't work. Once again those people are overlooking the fact that LMND is in a 4 trillion dollar addressable market, and that they have an insanely ambitious and competent management team.

**Proof that the management team has the ability to execute:**

So far Lemonade has high employee satisfaction, is ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for insurance, they already have a product that's arguably 10x better than the incumbent's (1/10 the time to process claims and onboard customers), they're achieving \~100% YoY growth, and they're currently releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months.

When Daniel Schreiber said the biggest bottleneck to their growth is being very careful and selective on who they hire into the company, that pretty much sold me that they will most likely become a very valuable company in the future.

The CFO also mentioned that it only takes 2 years for a customer to pay for him/herself. After that it's purely profits. Furthermore when a customer goes through highly predictive life cycles and eventually graduates from renter's insurance to home insurance, the revenues generated from that customer 6X's. That means they can continue pouring money into marketing, and will also most likely be able to keep up their insane revenue growth rate going into the future even as customer acquisition slows down.

I put a good amount of my portfolio in LMND when it was at $60. It makes up 30% of my portfolio now. I'm still not going to sell a single share, unless Schreiber or any of the management team decides to quit."|investing|Why I'm confident LMND is going to be a 10-100x investment in the long term|2.0|0.52

1612651988.0|0.0|t3_le90rz|28.0|"**Overview**

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biotech company that develops and commercializes medicines for treating various medical conditions worldwide. Its pipeline of products include:  EYLEA injection that treats several edemas; Dupixent injection to treat atopic dermatitis and asthma in adults; Praluent injection for clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults;  Kevzara solution for treating rheumatoid arthritis in adults;  Libtayo injection to treat locally advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; ARCALYST injection for cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes;  ZALTRAP injection to treat metastatic colorectal cancer.  

The point is that REGN has a strong and diversified pipeline of products. 

Meanwhile, REGN is also developing various product candidates for treating patients with eye diseases, allergic and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neuromuscular diseases, infectious diseases, and other diseases. The company has collaboration and license agreements with Sanofi; Bayer; Teva; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma; Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Roche Pharmaceuticals; and Vyriad, Inc., as well as has an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It has collaborations with Zai Lab Limited; Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.; and BioNTech

**Fundamentals** 

Despite operating in unprecedented circumstances of a global pandemic, REGN delivered strong commercial and financial results. For the full year 2020, Regeneron grew revenues by 30% and earnings by 28%, with an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams. In fact, more than 80% of revenue growth came from products and revenues, other than EYLEA. Also, the company discovered and developed a novel antibody cocktail against COVID-19 known as REGEN-COV.   Most recently, the company showed promising data suggesting that REGEN-COV reduces transmission of the virus and prevents infections in patients at high risk of contracting the virus.  With that discovery, a new supply agreement was established with the United States government for an additional 1.25 million treatment doses for up to $2.6 billion. 

**Technicals**

Although REGN price rose 34% in 2020, in the last 2 quarters it decreased nearly 20% from its 664$ peak in July 2020. While REGN's price reached its 6-month bottom at 477$, the company continued to perform extremely well amid the complicated situation of the pandemic. RSI(14) level points to 44.57 which indicates that the stock is becoming slightly oversold. 

**Conclusion**

The company is entering 2021 with strong momentum across its entire business. REGN is expected to generate a number of exciting catalysts this year, including a series of important launches for Libtayo in lung cancer and basal cell cancers, Dupixent data readouts and launches and milestones for other products that will further enhance the  diversity of sales and earnings and position the company for sustained financial growth. 

Thus, because of the misalignement between stock price and company performance, I believe that REGN is extremely undervalued and presents a strong buy opportunity for 2021."|investing|A bullish case for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)|28.0|0.75

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML?il=0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML?il=0)

This development could bode well for energy majors such [Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A/B)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RDS-B?p=RDS-B&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) that have invested heavily in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and have yet to see major returns on it. Now, just Amazon ordering a few hundred trucks would not swing the sector significantly by itself, but this could set a precedent for other companies to follow suit. As more and more companies set low carbon targets I wouldn't be surprised to see more stories about this. LNG is a less carbon intensive fuel than gasoline and diesel.

A bit more on RDS: I've been long RDS through the COVID epidemic and its shares have been (in my opinion) very discounted over the last year primarily because it took an early, drastic step in re-basing (lowering) its dividend. Shell is taking some noteworthy steps in restructuring the business model, with plans to only have SIX refineries in its portfolio by 2025 all of which are integrated with chemicals, biofuels, lubricants, or provide strong footing for its trading business. It's trimming its upstream assets to only a handful of cost advantaged fields and is planning on using cash generation there to bolster investments in what it has clearly outlined as its growth sectors (IE renewables). 

RDS has taken a different approach compared to a lot of energy majors in that it is investing in what it views as intermediate fuels versus full on electric: LNG, Hydrogen, Biofuels, etc and its plan is to leverage its large retail arm to deliver these products efficiently to customers. I see this as a decent moat as these are sectors that are harder to break into versus electricity (everyone and their mother has invested in solar and wind farms lately). Shell is [hosting a strategy day](https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2021/advance-notice-strategy-day-2021.html) to outline its plans going forward in which it is expected to discuss its business streamlining and plans for renewables. It may be worth a watch.

RDS has certainly taken a beating during COVID, as have all energy companies, but with Shell's unique portfolio and real steps towards preparing for the energy transition I wouldn't be surprised if it comes out as a very strong player over the next decade. It has plans to raise its dividend soon and has kept its balance sheet in nice tidy order through the stresses of COVID.

Risks I see:

* Can energy majors shake off the stigma of being ""oil and gas"" companies and receive due attention for investors?
* Will advancements in electric vehicles be significant enough to leap frog intermediate renewable fuels?
* Will divesting significant portions of its traditional oil and gas business leave it more cash strapped than expected?
* What is the actual timeline for seeing significant returns on its renewable investments?

What are your own thoughts on RDS? Or other oil majors making serious steps towards an energy transition?

I  gave it a little thought and to me logically, obviously, factually etc.  the best long term investment (at least 20-30 years) in the world is in  water. I might have been slightly inspired by the ending of The Big  Short where it's revealed that Michael Burry invests mostly in water -  he is also short in TSLA :). I was also inspired by Netflix's Rotten documentary series - the episode Troubled Water. 

Specifically I am talking about investing in companies dealing with the desalination of seawater business.

Facts supporting my claim/analysis:

Human  population doesn't stop growing and the planet is already overpopulated (around 2-3 billions more than it can normally support). This only means more and more water consumption. Population growth will reduce in 2050 or around that time but my idea is achieving growth until then.

It's projected that many areas around the world have medium to high water shortage risk around 2040.

Long term investments like Bitcoin and Gold cannot save you from dehydration if there is no water  to buy/drink. If two commodities (not essential to keeping you alive)  have trillions of $ of market cap, imagine what market cap could the  drinkable water reach if it becomes globally scarce.

Still  most water we use is freshwater found in nature - this water is  exponentially decreasing due to the industry demands, the pollution and  the increase in population. Global climate change probably helps as  well. There are also rains but not all rain water is drinkable. Sometimes they are also acid.

Literally almost everything  costs thousands of liters of water to make but we don't notice it  because there is still a lot of free/cheap and easily accessible water  for use. A cup of coffee takes 150 liters to produce. A kilogram of meat  takes 5000 - 20000 liters. 1 kg of chocolate takes 17 000 liters. Sure  not all of that is drinkable water but it's not dirty water as well so  water treatment plants will benefit from the need of such water.

Desalination  of seawater is a way to turn most of  the planet's water into drinkable water. The freshwater sources took  probably thousands of years to form and we almost depleted them mostly  in the last two centuries! Many people pointed out it's expensive and not economical but they don't consider the labor value if water becomes several times more expensive. Desalination plants wouldn't change much in price but the underlying product will which could make it an economically efficient investment.

The  desalination business is growing steady and is still very small which looks like a great investment opportunity. Market cap is just $32  billion. The global desalination capacity increased by 65% between 2010  and 2015 without any major global water events. Even in California it's  already a perpetual water crisis without an easy solution. With the fast  depletion of water everyone around the world will be forced to look for  alternatives and they could turn to desalination plants as there are not much alternatives.

At present there are **35 desalination plants** only in the UAE. They have no other efficient ways to get potable water as there are simply no freshwater sources around.

How to invest?

The  only almost perfect company I managed to find is CWCO (Consolidated  Water). I have stocks in it but I cannot make a very good recommendation  as I haven't discovered alternatives and I might be misleading  potential investors. I call the company almost perfect because it deals  with everything related to the business. But one issue is that currently  it heavily relies on tourism due to the location of it's plants. Do you  know of other 100% desalination companies?

Most  of the currently available investments in water are overall a joke -  water ETFs/indexes contain mostly water supply/utility/sewage companies  and/or companies which use a lot of water which is very non optimal if  one expects the price of water to increase in time. Think about it. If  you know that gold will increase in price would you invest in a company  which finds gold or in one which sells shovels for digging of gold (and  other minerals)...

Edit: I've corrected some initial wrong claims for which my apologies. Thanks a lot for the feedback and suggestions! I've added also my second inspiration."|investing|Best long term investment in the world is in water (desalination business)|399.0|0.77

Seriously though, rail is a solid investment and Canada’s largest freight rail line is a great candidate. Formerly a Canadian Crown Corporation, CN has been publicly traded since 1995 and Bill Gates is currently its largest shareholder.

Especially if you’re a commodities investor, you must acknowledge that rail, and particularly CN, is essential for moving commodities around Canada and virtually the only option for moving goods and commodities efficiently to and from Canada’s major shipping ports in Halifax, Vancouver and Montreal. The Canadian government has a vested interest in investing in and supporting CN for the good of the Canadian economy overall https://tc.canada.ca/en/corporate-services/policies/rail-transportation

CN has seen slow, steady growth for years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.575 CAD per common share. Speaking of CAD, CN might look like a good option for American investors given the $CAD/$USD disparity.

Suddenly Cathie Wood of ARK is adding it to her ARKK and ARKG funds

Meanwhile they make no money and have no real “product”. So is this a big bubble? What’s going on?

My belief is that BEAM has the longest runway for the development of new therapeutics based on CRISPR technology because they have the BEST technology.

The CRISPR technology that EDIT, CRSP, and NTLA use is essentially first generation CRISPR which cannot be targeted everywhere in the genome and has off-target effects.

BEAM is the brainchild of David Liu, a Harvard scientist who utilizes forward evolution to engineer next-generation CRISPR. BEAM is specifically licensed to use Dr. Liu’s CRISPR technology, specifically his “base editors” and “prime editors.” Making a long story short, BEAM has the technology to edit anywhere in the genome with less off-target effects than the tech of NTLA, EDIT, and CRSP. Also, as you may know, EDIT, NTLA, and CRSP have had longstanding patent battles over their technology. BEAM has no such issue.

So what’s BEAM’s plan?

 1. They can correct the ACTUAL sickle cell mutation that is present in patients. CRSP and the others are using their technology to turn on fetal hemoglobin production to bypass the mutation.

 2. In a collaboration with Verve, they showed they could correct the PCSK9 mutation in primates and PERMANENTLY lower blood cholesterol for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

 3. They also show data correcting the actual patient mutations in several liver diseases.

4. David Liu just had a paper in Nature showing they could correct the mutation that causes progeria, which is the disease where you rapidly age. 

Is the stock a bubble that may collapse? I hope so. I’ll buy the dip.

**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**

I made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.

**What this isn't: an ""I told you so"".**

  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a ""short ladder attack"" (for why that's not a think, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road.

**What this is: reflecting on the mob**

The shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting to manual approval only.  

I spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.

20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to lose even a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. 

We can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.

**You can, but should you?**

Much has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  

**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**

Ultimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the kindergarten aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  

This wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  

Next time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.  Write your senator, picket congress (peacefully, no mob bullshit), organize a sit in, whatever.  But let's not encourage broke people to give their hard earned thousands to hedge funds.  

**And most importantly, the next time this happens, because it will happen again, for the love of Christ try to understand what the fuck is going on before jumping on the hype train.  And stop downvoting and ridiculing people that do understand what is happening with an opinion you don't like.**

Immersion Corporation

Price $13.36 Market Cap $359.68M (Monday 1st February)

**Introduction**

Immersion is the world leading innovator of touch feedback technology, also known as haptics. The company provides haptic technology to create immersive and realistic experiences that enhance digital interactions on mobile devices. Immersion's technologies have been adopted in more than 3 billion digital devices that, along with mobile, include automotive, gaming, medical and consumer electronics. 

**Financials** 

Cash in the bank, zero debt 

Net income increased to $2.9M in Q3 2020

Gross margin +99%

31.30% insider ownership

Earnings came in way ahead of expectations with GAAP EPS ($0.11) and non-GAAP EPS ($0.15) both $0.10 better than expected.

Q3 revenue: 74% mobile 12% automotive 14% gaming

Short percentage of float 7.18% 

**Next earnings date; Thursday 5th March 2021.**

*Sourced from income statement and balance sheet - September 30 2020.*

**Why go long?**

The global haptic technology market is expected to grow from USD 2.6 billion in 2021 to USD 4.6 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 12.0%. Other forecasts suggest it could grow as high at $10B with increasing integration of haptics into consumer devices is the primary factor driving the market growth.

Immersion holds around 3,500 patents in their industry. The [protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_v._Sony) of their tech is a key factor in the long term prospect of this stock. IMMR has previously successfully sued both Sony and Microsoft over vibration technology installed in their console controllers.

The September 2020 earnings call highlight forecasted growth through 2021 of 214% largely tied to IMMR’s licensing agreement with Sony for PS5’s. Earnings are obtains per units sold, both on consoles and controllers. PS5 sales are booming with demand outstripping supply, resulting in Sony upping their 2021 sales targets and raising production by 50%.

Of potentially greater long term significance is the rumoured partnership with $TSLA. Tesla have announced they are working on a [new steering column and center console ](https://electrek.co/2020/02/06/tesla-new-steering-wheel-touchscreen-gear-stalk/?source=content_type:react%7Cfirst_level_url:article%7Csection:main_content%7Cbutton:body_link)which will include haptic technology. The reality is IMMR are most likely the only serious candidate. 

IMMR are perfectly portioned with their existing patents to continue to dominate their market, very limited completion and advance patented technology allows for their products to be licensed for greater margin, than traditional development contracts.

**Considerations**

Insiders have been selling most recently William C Market (Director) and Eric Singer (Director). In total $43,296,960.21 worth of shares have been dispositioned over the last 12 months.

**Conclusion** 

Immersion is well positioned to be a great medium to long term buy. Most attractive is its modest market cap suggesting a great upside. The comprehensive catalog of unique intellectual property and high margin licensing strategy is critical in delivering value going forward. Royalties from PS5 sales will likely boost revenue ahead of March’s results. Lastly 5G technology boasting mobile sales and the chance of a huge automotive partnership suggests that there is plenty of value in the company.

So my strategy is based on the rocket stocks book written by Matthew kratter. You start by looking for stocks that are hitting New 52 week highs I usually do this on barchart because it will also tell you the volume for that day. After you've found a stock that's had a new 52 week high.  Check to make sure it's gapping up in volume. After both those two are checked look to make sure that the current price is above the 50-day moving average and the 50-day moving average is above the 200-day moving average. It's not required but it is helpful if the cap is under five billion. It also helps if the float is low. 

Risk management: I would only put 10% of my portfolio into one stock. I would also have a stop loss at 10% of that stock so in total I would only be risking 1% of my portfolio. I would sell if I made 100% or higher profits, or if the price crossed below the 50-day moving average

[ Bot hates me so here is a link](http://www.bloomberg.com/news)

In the late 90's we had a similar Tech/Digital stock rally (this is not nearly as bad though, so chill, companies are actually destroying the estimates and profits are strong).

Back then it was web page development and internet providers, now it's mainly electric vehicles and some parts of tech. 

“St0nks” were only going up, up and up. You heard things like - Dude, its a new economy, this is the new normal. This is the future, you can't use old models to define value. Die all boomers and burn traditional stocks (ok I might be exaggerating on this one). 

Anyway, I was a finance major at a prominent university in London, UK. I was destined for greatness and a trainee spot at Deutsche Bank's analyst desk. My friend - let's call him Eli, because his name was actually Eli - was a stock genius. 

Everybody is a genious in a bull market, you put some money in to a company in IT and BAM, the new Buffett (or Cathie).

Eli was good for about 350kUSD at one point, not bad for a student. Or I should say, 350kUSD nominal value in stocks. Because, its not money until you sell. Eli learned the hard way.

The ""dip"" came. Eli figured ""st0nks only go up"" - I'm gonna ""buy the dip"". The dip became a slide, then a vortex and finally evolving in to a capital sucking black hole (not an anus ok).

Eli bought and bought, he also had a debt position of about 25% of his portfolio. This increased to 50%. The bank called, Hey Eli - that collateral isn't so hot anymore, pay up dude. Eli paid up. One year later he had -13kUSD on his account for accrued interest rates and trading fees.



So what's there to learn. Well, depends on how risk averse you are, but I see a lot of new investors that ask about when and how to take home profits. There is no rule or best practice, but here's at least an strategy that I'm using myself.


1. I don't let a stock grow beyond 20% of my portolio, if it does I automatically start scaling back profits and weight to other, new opportunities. 

Compound that interest, bitch.

2. I always keep a 10-15% cash position so I can take advantage on dips or other opportunities. This capital has had a ridiculous payback over the years. This is not money, this is capital. I have a savings account with 3 months salary. That’s money. 

3. For every 20% growth I take home for example 20% of the profit. So in G-ME for example I started buying early and by $90 I only had profits invested. By 300 I had sold about 2/3 and on the way down I dropped the last stocks at 115. 

So let’s say a stock grows from 100 to 120. I take back 4. Then it goes to 140, I take back another 8 so now I have taken 12 total. 

Obviously there is some flexibility here, but use it for inspiration. For more secure stocks you may wanna hold on more and longer, but for me it’s a lot about maintaining that cash position.


So what do I do with my profits? Well, I do a few things. 


1. I reinvest them in to other stocks, so I make sure I have a short list of alternatives at all times.  For example, my G-ME winnings (yes it was a casino) paid for 300 PayPal stocks at $231. They’re now up 15%. 

Compound that interest, bitch.


2. I put them in the cash position so I can be opportunistic (but still max 15%). Life saver in March, pure rocket fuel baby. 


3. I buy my wife or kids presents, I get a nice Rolex or refurbish the house.  I turn it in to money. I have money so I can spend it, use it. 



Moral of the story or TLDR;

Make money, you probably won't see another opportunity like the one of the past 6-10 months. Its not coming back for a while. 

Don't step out of the market, pick your stocks wisely, keep some cash to pounce on some disappointing earning calls or dips and remember: IT IS NOT MONEY UNTIL YOU SELL.

Disclaimer 2: I was a licensed financial advisor as in a securities analyst, but do your own research. This is not advice, it’s inspiration.

PS Eli went on to be a very successful entrepreneur and has started a few companies. I believe one of them is going to IPO soon DS

PBF energy is a independent oil refiner that has had it's stock price crushed over the past year, where it dropped from $30 pre pandemic to $9.50 now. It seems as if that drop may be justified since the company is currently posting -8.75 EPS and has accumulated a decent amount of debt.

Despite these challenges, I truly believe that PBF energy presents itself as a fantastic turn-around play, assuming the fact that oil demand can recover. Downstream companies like PBF energy are different fundamentally from E&amp;P companies since they don't necessarily rely on high oil prices to generate a profit. Compared to E&amp;P companies, refiners have low operating leverage, and profit from their refinery margin, which is the difference between crude oil and refined products. Because of this, I think the safest oil bets are within the Downstream sector, since they are least affected by the price of oil, and only rely on the return of oil demand.

Part of the reason that I think PBF energy is such a good investment opportunity is because it has a lot of intangibles that aren't being reflected by the market. Before the pandemic, it acquired the Martinez refining facility, but never had the chance to integrate the facility to generate profit. On top of of this, PBF Energy's refineries have some of the highest Nelson Complexity Ratings in the country. This puts PBF at an advantage compared to other downstream companies, since it can refine Heavy/Sour Crude blends more efficiently than other Refiners. Heavy/Sour blends often trade at a discount to more Light/Sweet blends, so PBF has more of an opportunity to take advantage of the price disparities between different kinds of blends.

Before the Pandemic, PBF exhibited extremely strong fundamentals, by showing strong growth in Revenue and Cash flow while maintaining growth in Capital Expenditures. As of right now, it is trading at a bout half of it's book value. Some hidden assets that the balance sheet may not reflect is PBF's 51% ownership in PBF Logistics, which handles PBF's Midstream operations. Another factor that may facilitate PBF's turnaround is that it has a huge Net Operating Loss Carry forward, where it's revenue for the next year may come tax free.

Overall, I think PBF energy presents itself as a worthy Turnaround play."|investing|Why I think PBF Energy is undervalued|25.0|0.87

A partnership with Amazon could be very big for them going forward as they have an immense trucking fleet. The company is banking on compressed natural gas engines as being the cleaner bridge between fossil fuels and an electric trucking fleet. They are headquartered in Vancouver, BC and have been around since 1995. What does everyone think about the company going forward? I would love to hear people's thoughts.

Well if you haven't been living under a rock, somewhat likely rumors about a merge between Churchill Capital and LUCID Motors may be underway. The reason why CCV being opened is such big news is that there may have been a deal struck between Churchill Capital and LUCID which is why Churchill capital needed to open a new ticker to replace the old one, as their original stock CCIV will be renamed with whatever the LUCID ticker will be. This is massive news and probably the reason why CCIV rose almost 15% today despite there being no confirmed news of a merge. What's also rumored is a super bowl commercial presented by LUCID Motors that will confirm the merge between the 2 companies. That one may be a stretch because it seems a bit late to reserve space for a commercial but only time will tell.

Keep in mind this is speculation. What I am saying isn't guaranteed to happen but I am very convinced personally that this will happen. Enjoy everyone.

That's a very simple statement, it's doesn't seem to offer groundbreaking value like a tech plays and at first glance, it doesn't seem to offer any reasoning why you should invest, bear with me and listen. I'll just outline a few reasons why Fiverr has been an extremely undervalued case an worthy of your investment:

(1) Fiverr has been extremely undervalued and **mispriced by at least half the Wall-street Analysts**, save for a few top ones, and its seems to be glossed over by many investors out there due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the business. Even the top Wall Street analysts on buy ratings seem to have glossed over the most important reasoning to buy the stock.  (As a side note, please note that the stock has **grown over 700%** in the past year.)

It is fundamentally, a **groundbreaking new Human Resources solution for SMEs**. It allows a marketplace for SMEs to find value talent, that would be impossible for them to source, both due to geographical and limited budgets.  Say, if I run my business in a small town, how can I find talent to do my artwork for my advertisement?  Fiverr provides me with the solution by offering ,say,  extremely talented individuals half way across the world in less developed countries for one-tenth of the price. To be blunt, it allows SMEs to source talented individuals in less developed countries for a value play.

(2) **Fiver has close to 0 true competitors in this space**.  Their so-called closest competitor 'Upwork' are targeted towards different markets.  Upwork is geared towards at the higher end of the market at large corporates while Fiverr is geared towards SMEs.  If you look at the way the platform is set up, they charge a much higher rate and the focus is on more complex projects.  I believe there is much more talent on Fiverr that is drawn across countries and geographies which would otherwise be very very difficult to access for SMEs.

To summarize, the Fiverr platform seems to shift **whole industries** online to provide value talent which would otherwise be extreme pain points for SMEs. **In short, this is the Alibaba of HR solutions for talent sourcing.**

(3) Now, lets talk about the valuation.  Fiverr is currently valued at approximately, 9 billion market cap, with 35 million shares and 20 million on float.  It's at the time of writing, at $270.  If you look at similar comparable, such as Etsy, both sites that offer work online, it is worth 27 billion.  That's three times the market cap of Fiverr.  In fact, I argue that Fiverr has a potentially larger market size than Etsy, the website offers work across a range of industries, from computing, all the way to advertising.  **That's potentially a 300%+ return** if you are looking at a long term investment.

(4) Why its good to get in now.  If you look at the amount of Fiverr stock Hedge funds have in their portfolio, a lot of them have none. There are a just a few hedge-funds with Fiverr in their portfolio (last time I check there were around \~10) and this has given them outsized gains. It doesn't help the fact that half the Wall Street analyst think that Fiverr is ""just"" a platform offering remote work opportunities and its only gaining steam now because of the coronavirus. That's fundamentally a mis-analysis in the true value of Fiverr. "|investing|FVRR: A Diamond in the Rough in plain sight|3.0|0.57

Their streaming product does not include any external media and thus they are not subject to the high costs of acquiring licenses for additional content.

CURI has partnered with Amazon Prime and Apple TV to add CURi as a paid channel, seamlessly attracting millions of new viewers.

They have shown YoY revenue growth of 90%, and although advertising spend seems high recently I expect this to continue to grow. While Disney+ is great for children, parents are going to want more educational content.

At the end of 2020, CURI had over 13M users. With a price point of only $12/yr., I don't see this slowing down anytime soon as they continue to get their name out to the public.

The US frozen food market is worth about 55 billion and the Tattoed Chef is trying to disrupt the market with quality foods that are plant based. A big part of this change is coming through the Millennial generation and Genration Z . The average millennial and Gen Z cannot cook, so what do they do take out and frozen foods. But with more of a focus on vegan and plant based foods. This is where the Tattooed Chef comes out to shine. The average man spends 290 $ at the grocery store and for women it is 323 $. How large is the Millennial and Z generation in a America you ask? 133 million Americans large and if they spend per say 20 dollars each for frozen foods that are plant based based. That is around 2,6 billion usd of revenue for the TTCF.

What does the Tattooed Chef have that the Very Good Food Company and Beyond Meat BYND doesn't ? The ability to have innovative products with a potential of 62 SKUs in 2021 and they are targeting around 200 SKUs. They are vertically integrated meaning that they own all forms of manufacturing and idea sharing. They can go from idea in to market in 3 days. They have all types of frozen foods in their products such as Single Serve Bowls, Smoothie Bowls , Vegetable Blends , Meat alternatives and Plant powered Pizzas. They have also launched a European commerce site as it will draw in new customers fromm all over the US.

They currently have 200k space of manufacturing room. They doubled in 2020 and will double in 2021 in manufacturing room. They are ramping up production as they are on target to reach 62 different SKUs. They have a plant in Italy and a plant in California the Italy plant will especially be good for European expansion in 2024. Their Certifications are on another level they have all of the organic seals of approval from the USDA.

Their Revenue increased 87% year o year from 2019 to 2020. It went from 58.1 Mil to 108.9 Million in 2020. Their gross profit also increased 70% from 9.9 Million to 16.8 Million in 2020. The adjusted EBITDA went up from 4.7% with a percentage of sales of 8.1%. It went up to 10.6% of total sales of 9.7%. They have not launched their Ad council yet but it should again help with total sales. Their predicted revenue of 2021 is 222 million which is almost a 100 percent raise of revenue. In 2022 their revenue should be 300 million with a Gross margin of 25 - 30 %. In 2023 it should be 500 million of revenue with as total margin of 30 to 35 %. In 2026 is the killer year with a predicted revenue of 1 billion with total margins of 35% plus. The adjusted EBITDA should be 20 % as of 2026 and in 2021 it should be in the main teens.

As of Q3 of 2020 their total assets were 66,718 million with 56,550 million of total liabilities.They recently exercised a warrant for 230 million worth of cash and it puts them at 296,718 million usd.

* Polypropylene (“PP”) plastic has a $98 billion global market spread across a wide range of industries and products of which &lt;1% of that market is derived from recycled material.
* PureCycle is a technology leader in recycling PP, it possesses a patented and proven purification process that produces nearly virgin-quality resin from plastics. 
* Strong pushes from both consumers and regulatory bodies to move towards the use of recycled plastic make for a great opportunity in an untapped market. 
* Despite strong market demand, PureCycle is the only player in the game with both the technology and cost competitiveness to supply recycled PP. As a result, it has already been approached with overwhelming interest from corporations.
* To play their parts in the drive for “Going Green” many corporations are targeting high rates of recycled content in PP products for the future.  PureCycle’s global commercial partners to date include L’Oreal, Procter &amp; Gamble, Total, and BMW, as well as several high-quality investors.
* There is a tremendous risk/reward opportunity at current prices, with revenue and EBITDA achieving hyper growth as plants come online with attractive economics, margins, and high ROIC. Assuming 30x EBITDA, TP YE’25 is $237 with shares trading at $19.00 today.

**The Play**

There is an increasingly big push from both environmentally-conscious consumers and governmental regulation to solve the building global plastic problem. As the Democrats assume power in Washington a push for environmental policy is expected, and single use plastic being banned in several states is just one example of the regulation to be expected for the future.  Most investors are focused on green energy and consumer technology, while waste management and recyclables go overlooked.  PureCycle is a revolutionary technology company focused on transforming waste PP into virgin-like resin. The same story that is driving enthusiasm for Enphase, Sunrun, and Tesla can be applied and seen for PureCycle Technologies. This is a massive global market for its taking, as no other companies or technologies can efficiently address PP recycling at scale. PureCycle holds the exclusive license to its patented solvent-based purification recycling technology, with the ability to commercialize it and bring recycled PP to market. With a disruptive technology, strong moat around the process, and tremendous demand given the consumer and regulatory environment, this creates an extremely exciting opportunity.

**The SPAC Deal**

PureCycle has struck a deal with ROTH CH Acquisition I that is expected to be finalized by the end of Q1 2021.  PureCycle is to be acquired by ROTH CH Acquisition I with $76.5 million in trust.  The deal is valuing the post-merger company at a $1.2 pro forma market capitalization and a $826 million Enterprise Value.  The Enterprise Value is from the 118.3 million shares of ROCH capital sold at $10 plus the $310 million in debt that PureCycle raised by selling municipal bonds and $60 million in convertible notes minus the $667 million in cash that PureCycle will receive from the selling the shares.  PureCycle plans on using the cash to finish Plant 1 and begin construction in Europe on Plant 2. 

**The Market**

PP is used across a wide range of industries, including consumer packaged goods, electronics, automotive, building and construction, and agriculture.  At the moment you see virgin PP in plastic containers, potato chip bags, razors, as well as food grade applications.  The recycled PP at the moment can only be used for dark plastic applications such as trash cans, rugs, and plastic furniture due to the greying color and unpleasant odors that still remain. 

The annual global demand of PP is roughly 173 billion pounds selling at approximately $0.57 a pound landing the total addressable market at \~$98 billion.  The PP market has grown at an average of 4% a year for the past 5 years and is expected to continue to climb at similar rates in the coming years.  As of 2020, due to polypropylene being extremely difficult to recycle, less than 1% (.8%) of all purchased PP is recycled.  The demand potential for high quality recyclable PP, technology moat, and large time and cost barrier to entry positions PureCycle in a very strong place to start to meet the demand and create a recycle loop that the market is desiring.  

An increasing number of companies are now setting sustainability mandates to act as a key differentiator. L’Oreal is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025, moving to 100% by 2030, while Procter &amp; Gamble is targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2030. In a $98bn market, broad sustainability goals targeting 50% recycled plastic by 2025 represents a $49bn opportunity in the next five years. The demand side of this equation can be satisfied by PureCycle’s world-first recycling process, as it produces high quality resin without compromising appearance, purity or performance. PureCycle’s product quality has been tested and validated by Procter &amp; Gamble, large contractual customers, and third-party engineering specialists. PureCycle is the only player able to capitalize on this tremendous demand opportunity and has already pre-sold 4x their existing capacity – all without a sales force. This technology can close the recycling loop for PP and be delivered in a cost-effective way.

**Proprietary Technology with Tremendous Pricing Upside**

PureCycle developed a physical separation process that utilizes a specialized solvent based purification process. All unit operations are well-known and commercially available at scales much larger than required by PureCycle and involves process operating conditions comparable to current polyolefin production conditions. This includes standard equipment like a Scheibel Extraction Column, a Decanter, Settler and Solid Extraction, candle filters, adsorption filters. This is important because it means the equipment is readily available and at the size that would be needed to scale the operations. The unique aspect here is what goes into the process, the filters/solvent used, temperature and pressure maintenance etc. This process also only consumes 1/7th the energy and is more cost efficient than producing virgin polypropylene. PureCycle can essentially recycle anything that has high PP content and create virgin quality resin. 

The attractive pricing upside is easily found in the market, with rates of virgin PP selling at \~$0.57 / lb and recycled PP costing between $1.00 to $2.00 / lb.  With regulation and consumer demand driving businesses to buy recycled PP and PureCycle having a much higher quality product produced at a lower cost to other recycled PP, it is safe to say there is a lot of pricing upside potential.  

**Unit Economi**

Plant 1, which is being built now in Ironton, OH, will be PureCycle’s least efficient plant with modeled price / lb of $0.90 and EBITDA / lb of $0.45. Plant 2 will be a more efficient plant with improved unit economics of $0.55 / lb. The forecasted business is to include 5 plant clusters, that are much more efficient, with 825m pounds a year in capacity.  The clusters give competitive advantage by leveraging the same infrastructure and reduced capex. 

PureCycle’s model was structured around a municipal bond that they raised, negotiated at 14 cents a pound for feedstock. However, owners of plastic waste are generally charged cost to get rid of it, which gives PureCycle a great opportunity to leverage the system to capture pricing at a much cheaper price point. 

The FCF and EBTIDA margin they are able to generate is extremely attractive at 58% and 56% even at the $1.00 price / lb. PureCycle’s growth strategy targets over $800 million in revenue with EBITDA margins in excess of 50% by 2024. 

The current business plan has PureCycle building \~ 1 billion in capacity over the coming 3-4 years and at $1 a pound results in $1b of revenue. At a 50% EBTIDA margin, PureCycle will do 500m in EBTIDA. All of this results in extremely attractive top line math, unit economics into margin profile, and return on invested capital. Additionally, the funding on these facilities can get 80% debt for the project level capex.  


**Competition?**

Other approaches to plastic recycling have existed in the market for decades, but they are limited in application, not cost competitive, and have failed to gain any meaningful traction as a result. Chemical recycling does not yield contaminant-free resin – limiting its potential food grade applications – and also has high energy costs. Mechanical recycling only works in limited use cases – not with any discolored feedstock, as the output becomes gray – and the product generally smells and looks unprofessional with melt flow index issues. PureCycle owns the only process that can take any feedstock and produce resin at a comparable virgin quality to virgin plastic -- usable for food-grade consumption.  PureCycle also has a solid margin profile, as they are able to produce the product at 1/7th the energy cost of virgin.

**The Bears Case**

Some investors are worried about the fact that Procter and Gamble are the true owners of the patents that created the technology and PureCycle is only leasing them. The concern is that for some reason P&amp;G licensed out the technology to other players.  P&amp;G decided to invest and develop the technology to solve a problem that they had with desiring to make their packaging from recyclable products.  They decided that they did not have the commercial ability to bring it to market and made more sense to find a 3rd party to scale the business and PureCycle was chosen.  The lead scientists and people from P&amp;G are still working with PureCycle in more of a partnership than simply licensing the technology out.  P&amp;G is still very heavily invested and desires to see the success and scaling of PureCycle for its own benefits and goals and has agreed to be on the line to personally protect the patents for PureCycle as part of the deal.  The current deal with PureCycle is an agreement to perpetuity, which should ease any hesitations by investors. No one else will be licensing this process/technology for the duration of the patents and Purecycle has developed a lot of their own patents as part of the commercialization efforts.

Another case against the buy is the fact that it is a SPAC deal between Roth and PureCycle and there is increased risk.  This is in fact true, but the reality is the deal has already been announced and is simply waiting for the SEC to sign off.  To date the SEC has not stopped an announced merger from closing for regulatory reasons and there is no reason to believe this deal should be any different.  Roth is excited about the partnership as they view the business as a slam dunk opportunity. 

**Guaranteed Revenue and LOI’s**

Major global commercial customers including L’Oreal, Procter &amp; Gamble, Ravago and Total have already signed agreements committing to purchasing hundreds of millions of pounds a year.  These contracts have already guaranteed 4 years of maximum output from PureCycle’s Plant 1. Many other major retailers have written LOI’s and are potential to fund and drive the growth of other facilities and plants.  PureCycle has a deal with Nestle who has a goal and company commitment to seeing that 100% of its packaging is 100% recycled by 2025.  I believe that for investors, PureCycle having deals with blue chip companies for long durations significantly de-risks any danger to revenue projections.  

**Forecasting Valuation**

From a valuation perspective, by looking at the landscape, environmental services companies, waste managers of the world trade at \~10x – 18x EBITDA. This includes players like Advanced Disposal, Republic Services, Waste Management. The process technology players such as Albemarle, Amyris, Trex, Rogers Corporation get a larger premium, trading at a \~20x – 25x EBITDA. For the players with high growth, high margin potential and in ESG, the multiple starts to jump up quite significantly to \~30x+ EBITDA, companies such as Enphase, Solaredge, Array, Plug Power, Ballard Power etc. 

Although there are no direct comps to PureCycle as the technology is one of a kind, I looked at Danimer Scientific (DNMR) who also recently completed a SPAC deal.  Both companies have been formed from P&amp;G developed patents to address the plastic problem that the environment faces.  Danimer did purchase the patents outright but have owned them for close to 10 years and are still working to get the business going.  Based on side-by-side comparisons of both companies self-projected business you can clearly see that PureCycle is trading at a significant discount. 

**Conclusion**

Based on the price action of CCIV, the original Lucid investors could see how hot their brand is, maybe it really could be a major Tesla competitor, if not a killer.

The original CCIV market capitalization was 1.5B billion at $10 per share. Assuming the original Lucid investor think the company have a optimistic estimate of 30 billion dollars as initial market capitalization (you can try different numbers to come up with a different final market capitalization estimate), which means there will need to be a lot of PIPE investment at $10 dollars a share, even with the original share holder keeping a large percentage (say 70%) of the company.

In this scenario, at the conclusion of the merger, the CCIV share holder would hold about 5% of Lucid Motor.  With the CCIV current stock price, Lucid Motor market capitalization could reach about 100 Billion.

Ok, so Wells Fargo (WFC) was hit hard by the pandemic and unlike most other banks, WFC has underperformed in recent years. Not only did the pandemic hit them hard but fed regulations due to their fake accounts scandal really limited growth. They were primarily focused on commercial lending. Their investment banking was just a very small percentage of their operations. So when the pandemic hit, it hit WFC really hard. 

So the reasons I like WFC:

1. As we come out of the pandemic, this focus on consumer lending should be an asset for WFC. 
2. Their new management has focused a lot on control measures so that there will not be another scandal.
3. They are expanding their investment arm.
4. They have lots of money in reserve for buybacks which could see the stock price climb.
5. Also, they were one of the few big banks that cut their dividends. I expect that to return so not only with the price climb, I'll see extra revenue from dividends. 
6. They are cutting expenses.

I got in when the price was around $28 a share. I think the stock could climb to prices pre-pandemic (40s/50s) and maybe even higher, this year or next. Their new CEO has proven good and brought necessary changes. But this could take a while."|investing|Why I'm BANKING on Wells Fargo|10.0|0.61

Currently heavily invested in this stock when I picked it up for about 2 bucks a share a while back. Holding for long term. Appreciate your guy's thoughts on how to financially think about these kinds of companies what to watch out for interns of losses before coming to market, acceptable debt loads, etc. 

**My Background:** 

I am a 6+ year researcher/physician and currently a emergency medicine doc who enjoys picking biomedical stocks by reading the actual scientific literature behind the companies. I have been personally published in some of the top journals in the country. Some biomedical companies I can tell right off the bat it is based on a ""weak"" premise or the upside of a new therapy is too small to change clinical practice. One company I have been following closely is EYEN, an ophthalmology company originally the brain child of a Harvard School of Medicine Professor.

Things I like about EYEN: 

**Micro-applicator Patent:** They hold great patents for a macrodosing applicator for ophthalmology drop applications. This is a huge deal as its first in the industry to offer such as patent. As a physician the ability to micro dose things like steroids to the eye for extremely common problems like glaucoma is fantastic. Currently we rely on dropper bottles that have a predisposition to cause systemic circulation of drugs you do not want systemically spread. Interestingly in the clinical trials they showed easy use of the applicator from 6 year olds all the way up to &gt;80 year olds. 

**Repurposing Old Drugs + Micro-applicator:** this is the major reason I am very bullish on EYEN. They have shown success in repurposing old drugs for improving farsighted vision. These are old drugs that have been around forever. They essentially contract the muscles controlling pupillary constriction to improve vision. They're clinical trials are fantastic and very promising. The biological mechanism is sound and the drug is safe making it seem to me as a physician a no brainer. Millions could chuck out their contact lenses/ glasses for a micro dosed pharmaceutical option."|investing|Why I'm bullish on EYEN… clearer vision using a old drug.|21.0|0.85

* There will be another significant market downturn.  It could be tomorrow or 10+ years ... but it will happen.
* Fed is committed to keeping rates low for next year or two.

__Question__: What happens if the next downturn occurs during the upcoming year(s) of low rates?

__Context__:  After almost every market down-turn since the 1980s, the Fed lowered rates ... see the link.  However, this time rates will be bound at 0 and the Fed will have little ability to stimulate (assuming fed doesn't go negative).  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRLTLT01USM156N

__My Thoughts (from America POV)__:
If a crash occurs during the low rate period, it could be the catalyst that breaks America's relative outperformance compared to the rest of the world.  The Fed's inability to stimulate and the current sky-high valuation could imply a decade of stagnant US equities.  I think that emerging markets would likely do very well in this environment.

I'm not saying that this will happen, just curious what the implication would be if it did happen.  I do think there's a chance we escape this fate.  For example, COVID shutdown end, euphoria, fiscal policy and savings propel massive customer spending, Fed increases rates to curb inflation and rates climb before the next crash.

In mature markets like Pennsylvania, Indiana, and West Virginia, the per capital annual betting handle is $500-$600. Using that figure across the entire US, that would make the sports betting annual handle $200B, if sports betting was legal in every state. With a 6% average industry hold, that makes the potential annual revenue in this space $12B.

DraftKings - should have a 25% market share in sports gambling. That equates to annual revenue of $3B. If they have a 33% net margin on their business, that would equate to $1B EBITDA. Assuming their fantasy business is worth $4B, that means the sportsbook part of the business is being valued at 20x EBIDTA for a best case national gambling roll out, which is years and years away.

Penn National/Barstool Sports - should have a 10% market share in sports gambling. This equates to annual revenue of $1.2B. They will have a higher net margin because of Barstool, so let's say 45%, which equates to an EBITDA of $540M. Assuming their brick and mortar casino business is worth $5B, that means the sportsbook business is being valued at 28x EBIDTA for a best case national gambling roll out, which is years and years away.

Rise Interactive/BetRivers - should have a 7% market share in sports gambling. This equates to annual revenue of $840M.

It trades at a multiple of around 13-14, is a large cap, has brand recognition, and is likely to continue to be successful in all its endeavors. It is my biggest gainer percentage wise since last year, which I would not have predicted. Around 45% since I bought at 80 and it's not even a ""meme stock.""

13-14 p/e is quite low for a successful company, much less a tech stock. I have beaten down REITs trading at a higher p/ffo multiple. Its long term chart looks a little scary but it was a victim of the dot com/tech bust. At the current multiple it looks like one of the safer technology stocks to hold compared to megacaps trading at 40 or 200.

Revenue is expected to be over 80 billion as of March 2021, which is an increase over prior years. Profit margins are at 27% which is quite good. Yield is minimal but it has experienced a 5 year CAGR of 42%, so if dividend growth is your thing, Sony hits the spot. Video gaming is expected to grow for years, prices have increased, and the hobby is now very well established rather than fringe or simply for juveniles.

I posted here on [Monday morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9unrf/containership_boom_ongoing/) on these stocks, but news is quickly improving even further, so it merits yet another update. Since last Friday, my top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 27%:

· DAC: +24%

· NMCI: +25%

· NMM: +27%

As I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance NMCI trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

The latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. ""Diam hands"" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!

The 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like NMCI (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.

This is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing DAC has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and a guy I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...

I believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.

**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector, but most specifically DAC, NMCI, and NMM. NMM will likely be acquiring NMCI via a merger at 0.39 ratio in the next few weeks.

**Questions/Pushback:**

1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon?

The rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.

2) Is this like ""tankers?"" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks!?

Tankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.

3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon?

Containerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.

4) I like NMCI, but my understanding is NMM is buying them, how to choose?

In my \*personal opinion,\* the best thing is to buy whatever is cheaper. So I take NMM and multiply by 0.39 and buy the cheaper one. As I'm writing this, NMCI is much cheaper than NMM by about 3-5%. Why? I believe it's mostly because people can buy NMM and sell $17.50 or $20.00 (or higher) covered calls against it for a premium. NMCI doesn't have a liquid options market. This is a temporary spread and I believe it will close within 3-6 weeks when the merger is (likely) completed.

5) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!

I hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips (DRYS) was one example of a horribly managed firm.

6) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market?

The average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.

***Disclosure:*** I’m long nearly every name in the space- ATCO CPLP DAC MPCC (Oslo) NMCI NMM ZIM. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. ""Diam hands"" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I just sold CMRE this morning and rolled it into ZIM).

I have about 10% of my wealth in $NMCI/$NMM. Average basis in NMCI is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.

I have no plans to pull out (very childish), but I want to be on top of any and all scenarios where there is a massive buying opportunity. I've decided to hold an additional 15% worth my portolio in cash. This cash strictly for investing, not personal. The hope really, is that I never deploy that capital and the rest of my account keeps going up. 

How does everyone else deal with bears, buying opportunities and cash?

Note: Almost all investment forums suggest investing 100% of your portfolio into equities unless you're getting near your retirement/exit.

EDIT: **Take Aways from the Comments**

1. Take some profits out of high returning ETFs (i’ll do about 10% of my gains) and leave them in cash for a good buying opportunity.

2: Open a margin account with your broker so you can do a quick cash injection if there is a good buying opportunity. (Assess comfort level)

3. Selling covered puts (Sounds like an amazing option but ill need to do a little more research)

I'd  like to talk about the Telos Corporation, ticker TLS. It IPO'd back in  November and I'm curious about what others think of it as a long term  play.

# Basics:

Telos  is a cybersecurity company focused almost entirely in the government  technology sector. They've been around for decades, but only just went  public in the last year. At the time of this writing, they are trading  at a P/E of 148.48 and EPS of -$0.1229. They currently hover around a  $2B market cap.

Some of their clients include the FBI, State Department, FedEx, Raytheon, Verizon, and Citi.

Some of their partners include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Palo Alto networks.

# Products/Services:

Like  I said earlier, Telos operates in the cybersecurity space. Their  largest/most popular product seems to be their ""Xacta"" platform, which  is an automated tool to check an organization's compliance to national  cybersecurity standards. Additionally, Xacta works as a continuous risk  assessment suite that can detect and remediate gaps within an  organization's security infrastructure.

In additon to Xacta, they offer Telos Ghost. According to their website, Ghost is

&gt;a  robust, scalable, secure communications network-as-a-service that  privatizes the public internet to hide network resources and masks the  identity  and location of personnel to ensure total protection as they  conduct their operations. These same capabilities can also hide servers,  applications, and  unified mobile communications to ensure completely  private voice, text,  video, and chat over any device.

Telos also offers myriad services from consulting to pen testing.

# Financials:

I'll  be up front, I am horrible with understanding financials of a company.  I'll just report here what I see on the Schwab research page for TLS.

For  the fourth quarter 2020, analysts estimate TLS will generate revenues  of $44.5M, a decrease of 4.31% over the prior year fourth quarter  results. Their annualized growth rate over the last four years is 4.5%.  In terms of debt, it looks like they are solidly in the red and have  been for some time with total equity decreasing from -$125M in 2015 to  -$141M in 2019.

93.7% of last year’s sales came from U.S. federal government contracts.

Leadership

Telos  is lead by CEO and Board Chairman John Wood. It looks like he's been  with the company for almost 30 years, and been CEO since 1994. It seems  that much of the management for Telos has been with the company for  quite some time.

Interestingly, Keith Alexander (former 4-star general and director of the NSA) was added to the advisory board last May.

# Personal Opinion

I  was lucky enough to get in on Telos at below $20 and have enjoyed the  massive runup in the last couple of months. I'm not sure how much steam  it has left in it, but I do consider it to have some growth left. After  the SolarWinds disaster, the government will likely increase its posture  in terms of cybersecurity and Telos seems poised to answer the call.  Additionally, with former government officials advising the board, it  seems likely that connections exist to get Telos into the hands of the  government organizations that need it most. The biggest turn offs for me  are its large debt and the fact that the company has been around  forever and only recently went public. This was probably just a means to  raise funds. I might take profits soon and let the rest ride.

I  am not a financial advisor or analyst and really have no idea what I'm  doing. Invest at your own risk and always do your own due diligence.

I'm curious to hear anybody else's thoughts.

1612541122.0|0.0|t3_ldabwx|9.0|"I personally really like their idea here - the ETF invests 98% into the S&amp;P500, then invests 2% each year into SPX put options (they continually invest put options that are way out of the money, expiring in the next year).  This reduces the annual return each year by 2% when compared to the S&amp;P - but can provide a great deal of protection when the market drops.  

They have back-tested their model against 08/09 and also the drop in early 2020, and claim that losses during these periods would have been reduced by over 50% (i.e. if the S&amp;P was down 50%, SPD would only be down 25%).  Not actual numbers, just ballpark for illustrative purposes. 

I personally think there is a high likelihood of a 30% drop sometime in the next 3-5 years.  Even if SPD doesn't provide as much downside protection as they claim, I think its a good move for someone looking for general S&amp;P exposure but with reduced risk for large drops.  Thoughts?

Hey Everyone. Hope you're all having a great day :)

I just wanted to get some thoughts on Walmart,  their share price has been up and down (mainly down since mid December) given everything that is going on; the lawsuit about the potential role in the opioid crisis, the tweet about Josh Hawley, 

However more recently, Walmart sold a majority share in ASDA (UK supermarket &amp; retailer) for $6.8bn. Walmart are also awaiting the delivery of COVID vaccines as well as some other US pharmacies and retailers. Due to this, I have a suspicion that their share price will recover to what it was before the shenanigans of December last year, and then continue to grow.

Let me know your thoughts, I'm still learning and growing as a trader and investor so please feel free to critique my short DD here.

Cheers,

1612539711.0|0.0|t3_ld9t9t|10.0|"Made a post about this yesterday re: what TD and other banks are charging every time you buy US securities with CAD, whether this is from a Margin, TFSA or RSP account. There is conflicting information on their website, as one commenter pointed out, it says a range between 3-3.5%. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's actually only the spread on foreign currency, which changes every day and it depends on how much you're converting. For example, its about 1% for $30,000-44,000. On top of this, the $9.99 commission is charged in the currency of the equity you are purchasing (e.g. $10 USD for buying a US security).

Solution:

This part is based on TD Web Broker, but should work for other banks. Good new is, you can get around this by transferring you funds to a US RSP or TFSA account, which won't trigger penalties, as they are more or less than same account, only separated in your brokerage web page for visual clarity. You have two options for transfer: either go to Accounts and select 'Cash Transfers and Foreign Exchange' if its sitting in cash or 'Securities Transfer' if you have it tied up in US stocks. You can also call their Web Broker line, like I did, if the button isn't working. TD said it would take one business day for RSP and two days for TFSA to transfer. If you call and have them do it 'back of house, (e.g. calling) you need to remove any pending orders, possibly also stop losses, or they may not start the transfer, as they will wait until orders are settled. In which case, it may be safer just to sell and transfer when you have the cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Once it's in the proper account (US TFSA) you will no longer be penalized for currency conversion, until you take the money out in CAD or purchase CAD stocks (or any non-USD listed security). Only cost should be the $9.99 US commission on each trade, which is lowered after you hit a higher threshold of trades, per quarter.


Edit: for people saying Norbert's Gambit is a better way, here is why I disagree: Two things: one, this is typically done in chunks and involves several steps each time you convert (e.g. Get a quote for DLR and calculate how many shares you can buy for the CAD in your account, place an order for that number of shares. The trade will settle in Canadian dollars, then call your discount brokerage’s customer service desk and ask them to take your DLR shares and “journal them over” to the U.S. dollar side of your account, where they should show up as DLR.U., the place an order to sell all of your DLR.U shares. The trade will settle in U.S. dollars).

Second: most brokerages don't allow Norbert's Gambit with RRSP accounts.

The way I outlined you pay only one conversion commission: when you take the money out in CAD.

**23andme is a consumer DNA-testing company. They were founded in 2006 and seems to have a huge market share for d2c DNA testing.**

Going into the future, I believe that many people will definitely have their DNA sequenced. This is not a fad or a gimmick. Sure, some people might buy a DNA test for novelty purposes to find out their ancestry, but by sequencing your DNA, you would be able to identify a HUGE array of potential health issues.

* Their app is apparently quite nice to use and miles ahead of the competition. I could envision that in the near future when you open the app you would be able to buy tailor-made supplements to improve your health, specific to your genetics
* They'd also be able to use your gene data for specific diseases to develop drugs to treat them. H U G E
* Predictive abilities will improve as their dataset grows. Eg. they have a tool that tells you whether you would get severe symptoms in the event that you do catch COVID-19. This tech will improve and become a necessity to a modern healthcare plan
* Usually IPOs are first offered to institutional investors, by the time it hits the market, normal retail investors like you and me end up paying the highest prices for the shares. But with a SPAC like $VGAC, we're getting in on the ground level.
* &amp;#x200B;

**I can see this doubling or tripling in value in the near future just based off of how cheap the prices are right now.**

Other biotech stocks typically trade at 30-40 PE ratio. If we use that multiple on their $220M current revenue, the company would be worth between $6.6bn - $8.8bn....

* The EU carbon market is a tiny market ready for disruption.
* Prices rose in 2020 despite a fall in emissions because the carbon market is in a deficit, but remains well below its fair price.
* Fundamentals are in place for a bull-run (rising demand as economies re-open, govt capping supply, EU drive to cut emissions further).
* Technicals suggest now is the time to buy, with a significant breakout on volume expansion, and no overhead supply.
* The KRBN ETF is the best way to go long carbon.

# EU carbon market is tiny market, ready for disruption

The EU carbon market works on a 'cap and trade' principle. A 'cap' is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases, and companies receive buy or sell allowances. Heavy polluters buy allowances from cleaner companies.

The EU's carbon market is the oldest and largest carbon market in the world. Yet, it is tiny in comparison with other commodities. It is limited to just 11,000 heavy energy-using installations in industries hand-picked by the EU (e.g. power stations and industry).

Every day, 32 million EU carbon allowances change hands. That's almost 3x less than GameStop's 97.71 daily trading volume (10-day moving average).

# Carbon market is in a deficit

Carbon prices rose in 2020 despite a 14% fall in emissions because the carbon market is in a deficit. They fell around the same time as the March sell-off, but recovered once vaccines were announced, and rose further in December when EU leaders agreed to more ambitious emissions reduction targets  (Source: [https://www.refinitiv.com/content/dam/marketing/en\_us/documents/reports/carbon-market-year-in-review-2020.pdf](https://www.refinitiv.com/content/dam/marketing/en_us/documents/reports/carbon-market-year-in-review-2020.pdf)).

Carbon prices have been in a clear uptrend since 2016, after the EU took steps to create a structural deficit, and have room to rise further:

* Every year, the EU reduces the total number of allowances by 1.47%.
* In 2015, the EU established a mechanism known as the Market Stability Reserve (MRS) to remove surplus allowances. In 2020 alone, the MRS reduced the 2020 auction volume by some 35% (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/carbon-market-report-emissions-eu-ets-stationary-installations-fall-over-9\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/carbon-market-report-emissions-eu-ets-stationary-installations-fall-over-9_en)).

Hedge fund participation may have also helped the latest February rally to new highs.

# Fundamentals are in place for a bull-run

A higher carbon price is a pillar of the EU's emissions reduction policy. And all signs point to a bull-run as demand rises further, and supply falls, driven by the EU's more ambitious emissions reduction targets.

Demand drivers:

* The economic recovery is ahead of us, with Covid vaccinations on the rise.
* By June 2021, the EU Commission will make proposals that could expand the EU ETS to more sectors and more gases. It has already stated its intention to include the maritime sector (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/)).
* By June 2021, the EU is expected to announce a carbon tax at its borders. This will further strengthen demand for EU carbon credits and prevent ""carbon leakage"". (Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-carbon/eu-sees-carbon-border-levy-as-matter-of-survival-for-industry-idUSKBN29N1R1?edition-redirect=in](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-eu-carbon/eu-sees-carbon-border-levy-as-matter-of-survival-for-industry-idUSKBN29N1R1?edition-redirect=in))

Supply drivers:

* The EU has announced that it will increase the pace of annual reductions in allowances to 2.2% (up from 1.47%) starting in 2021 (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision_en)).
* The EU has announced that it will double the number of allowances put in the Market Stability Reserve until 2023. Allowances in reserve will expire faster, further restricting supply (Source: [https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision\_en](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/revision_en)).

# Carbon price above 100 Euros?

Institutional investors are confident that the price is on a clear upward trend. The following snippets are sourced from Bloomberg (Source: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/andurand-sees-carbon-tripling-as-funds-turn-bullish-on-pollution](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/andurand-sees-carbon-tripling-as-funds-turn-bullish-on-pollution))

Andurand Capital Management, which successfully bet on oil prices after the 2020 crash, expects that carbon will ""**hit 100 Euros** ($121) per metric ton of carbon emissions, possibly as soon as later this year"". If their forecasts are accurate, we'd see prices rise 160% above current levels.

Per Lekander, fund manager at London-based Lansdowne, sees carbon prices **between 50 Euros and 100 Euros** per ton within a year or two, partially boosted by demand from steel, cement and airlines. Anything below 50 Euros would be too low to meaningfully influence any industry outside the power sector, he said.

Northlander Commodity Advisors also predicting a surge this year to **50 Euros and 70 Euros** by 2025. According to its Ulf Ek, chief investment officer at Northlander, ""It’s the best time to invest since early 2018"".

The downside risk is that the EU intervenes to cap prices, should they rise too high too fast. However, I see two mitigating factors. First, the EU is notoriously slow to act, with decisions turnaround stretching over years. Second, the EU could support industries affected by excessively high carbon prices through tax breaks / subsidies, without directly interfering with the price of carbon itself.

To this end, it invests primarily in EU and, to a lesser extent, Californian carbon allowance futures. It has an 0.79% expense ratio, towards the low end for actively managed funds and small in relation to the potential upside.

*Disclaimer: I am long KRBN because I believe the price of carbon should, and will, rise higher.*"|investing|Carbon Price Ready for Take-Off (KRBN:ARCA)|14.0|0.83

**KOSPI Touches 3,000**

In early January, investors rejoiced when they heard the news that the Korea Stock Price Index, or KOSPI, passed the 3,000-point threshold. The KOSPI is a capitalization-weighted index of all common stocks exchanged on the main board of the Korea Stock Exchange. As a benchmark index of the Korean stock market, it follows a variety of industries, bonds, options, and futures.

When the KOSPI was first introduced in 1983, it was traded at 122.52 points. It reached its worst point, 31.96, during the 1998 financial crisis. In 2020, with the quick spread of the COVID-19 virus, the KOSPI dropped to 1,457.84 points on March 19. However, it rebounded and reached the 3,000-point plateau in the first week of January. The index increased by [30.8%](https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/12/30/2020123002203.html) (Korean link) over the year, which is the highest increase rate among the G20 countries’ stock indices.

The main driving force behind this remarkable increase seems to be [individual investors](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210106002200320) purchasing local stocks on the mainboard, as Yonhap reported. Individual investors purchased a net ₩38.1 trillion worth of local stocks from March 1 to December 30, 2020. In contrast, during the same period, non-Korean stockholders sold a net ₩21.5 trillion and institutions discharged a net ₩8.2 trillion.

**Young “Ants” Swarming into the Stock Market**A particular aspect of this increase is that a vast number of individual investors newly jumped into the market. To describe this phenomenon, internet slang expressions such as the “Donghak Ant Movement (동학개미운동)” emerged. The Donghak Ant Movement is a compound of two words: “Ant” and the “Donghak Movement”.Ant as a slang term refers to individual investors who don’t know much about the stock market compared to professional, full-time investors. The Donghak Movement is an uprising that took place in 1894, during the Joseon Dynasty. The movement was led and organized by peasants against feudalism and the invasion of foreign powers.The term “Donghak Ant Movement” started to become popular on the internet, as people joked about the “ants” buying local stocks to prevent the steep decline of the KOSPI caused by non-Korean investors’ offloading being similar to those peasants who fought against foreign powers. As mentioned above, the KOSPI had dramatically dropped after non-Korean investors and institutions offloaded their stocks, but the Korean ants [raised the index](https://www.donga.com/news/Society/article/all/20200407/100547492/1) (Korean link) to a record-high number by [purchasing more stocks](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210106000969) in response. The emergence of the term thus illustrates the noticeable change that occurred in the stock market last year: an increase in private, domestic investors.

The new, rather inexperienced ants were instigated to participate in the happenings on the stock market by an influx of newly launched mobile trading system (MTS) [applications](https://www.hankyung.com/economy/article/2021020330926) (Korean link). 

MTS applications allow users to trade small shares of a company’s stock, which enable them to start investing with a small amount of seed money with no transaction fees charged. Users can also open bank accounts for stock trading, or share accounts via the applications, without visiting banks. What’s more, many of these applications adopt artificial intelligence or other systems to provide [consulting services](http://www.newspim.com/news/view/20200904000641) (Korean link) and recommendations for their users.

Thanks to the improved accessibility to the stock market through MTS applications, the number of individuals making small investments in stocks has increased in the country. Compared to 2019, [more than four times](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2020/12/1279378/) (Korean link) the number of individual share accounts were opened in 2020.

MTS applications are also the main channel to the stock market in general. According to the Korea Exchange, MTS applications represent [40.66%](https://weekly.donga.com/3/all/11/2239376/1) (Korean link) of all transactions, followed by the home trading system (38.89%), branch terminals (10.44%), and automated response service (0.23%), in 2019. The [home trading system](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2013/08/123_90219.html) refers to computer software for stock trading.

Notably, more people in their 20s or 30s, mostly inexperienced in stock trading, recently jumped into the stock market with the help of these MTS applications. The term *julin-i* (주린이), a union of the prefix *ju-* (주식, stock) and the suffix *-lin-i* (short for 어린이, child), started to circulate on the internet as the number of young investors increased. The term denotes “newbies” who don’t have a good understanding of the stock market yet.

After more profits Mark would use a trailing stop loss to closely monitor the price and exit in a favorable position with his profit in tact. This is the part where I’m confused. I understand that trailing stop loss follows price increases and stops when price decreases. So what would my stop loss be if I have 20,30,40% profit?

Right now one of my trade has a 20% profit. I set the stop loss at break even + 5%. Giving the trade a 15% wiggle room, is this too much room? The stock exchange I use has a 7% limit fluctuations for every stock meaning it cannot go below 7% any given day.

Hi Beautiful people,

Does anyone know any reputed broker who offers trading(buy/sell/hold) ONLY the futures of crypto currency as opposed to the underlying currency and does not charge horrendous interest rates (25%) for the same?

IMPORTANT: Without going into the detail reasons(security risks), the broker I am looking for should NOT allow buying the underlying crypto under any circumstances. Hence, ONLY crypto futures.

Based on my preliminary research I found that Binance offers Crypto futures with a decent interest rate of 8-10%. However, I do not know if they have an account type which ensures that my account CANNOT be used to buy underlying crypto.

Any insights would be appreciated.

would like to know what you think of the US push to further decirminalize cannabis on the federal level? 

in my view there are several considerations around this regulatory change that could positively influence investment outlook:

1.The no brainer states that want to decriminalize or already have have a better legal backing. 

2.Companies suddenly will have access to non-venture funding, banking services (which as I understand at this point is not the case) 

3. Will become more intersting investment case for the traditional market (pension funds etc)

4.Could be the new tabacco or alcohol?

Hi to everybody reading this, I am an investor based in Europe focusing a lot of my studies on the United States market primarily. Most of my research and time is spent perfecting my forecasting skills, not through a lot of bullshit that seems to have thrived, but through analyzing of value. Value's aspects are where true returns can always be found, and the only problem value can face is the price you pay. I'm writing this because of the opinion I have on the economic state of the market that is about to appear at any time.

A market crash can happen for many reasons, but forget that and let's get specific. The Dotcom crash was a major crash that happened around 2000, the reason for it is the same reason I believe the upcoming crash will happen.

What is it?

It's speculation.

But what's wrong with speculation?

**NOTHING.**

You bet on the market depending on what you believe is going to happen to certain industries, and that is not only a method for great profits but something anyone should have the access to do. If the story ended there it would be great. The issue is that the rate at which speculation is taking place, has reached a new level. Therefore when putting the price you pay for stocks, against their actual earnings you get an estimate of how overvalued the stock market is. This ratio is high. Really high.

But isn't that because companies are growing?

Not even close.

Ratio is a relationship, if price grows faster than the actual performance of companies, that is a case of being overvalued and not reflecting company growth anymore. What to do? Well, watch your trades, make sure you know what you're buying/selling and make sure that **crowd's opinion isn't always yours too.**

I decided to share my thoughts, since a lot of people (and analysts) seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stock.I want to give a quick and **very abstract** introduction on technical terms:

# Technicalities

BB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.

Why would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.

However some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).

# Contra BB (QNX):

The following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):

1. Toyota
2. VW
3. Daimler
4. Ford
5. Honda
6. BMW
7. GM

&amp;#x200B;

1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).
2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.
3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.
4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.
5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.
6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.
7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.

I didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)

# Pro BB (QNX):

Developing an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).

# Conclusion

In my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).

Furthermore I just searched through job listings for ""QNX"" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).

Although Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.

I see some parallels with Payoneer but patience is the key. This is not really a r/SPAC play as much as its a r/investing play. (No comment on r/WSB.) While getting added to ARKF would be nice for a near-term pop, sometimes lying low to get your act together is a good thing. PayPal benefitted from the same dynamic until investors realized the company's scale was enormous. (Obviously, the eBay relationship played a huge role but the stock traded in the $80-110 range for two years before Covid drove the stock up 3x.) There will come a point when investors realize Payoneer's opportunity, but right now the opportunity is buried under mediocre financials (see below) and a frothy SPAC market for which anything less than a 50% pop at DA is a dud.   It's only when you dig deeper into the potential scale benefits and where the current investments are going that you realize this may be PayPal 2.0. **Hence, thee current situation is actually a great opportunity for Payoneer investors.**

Obviously, I would encourage everyone to do their own DD starting with the investor [presentation](https://pubs.payoneer.com/docs/investor-presentation.pdf?_ga=2.142077554.1186770460.1612586492-2042252415.1612359068) and [webcast](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1426630&amp;tp_key=f7e0f9ea11). I personally found the presentation short on key metrics and financial detail and long on buzz words. (I guess $95mn in bankers' fees only buys so much these days.) That said, the acquisition has yet to close and Payoneer needs to be prudent. I would also add that while I avoid stereotypes, Payoneer seems to be another addition to Israel's strong lineage and tradition of building great technology companies where the MO seems to be under-promise and over-deliver.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Payoneer (FTOC)**

**Summary:** Payoneer offers investors exposure to mobile and digital commerce, particularly cross-border transactions, at a reasonable entry point. What makes the investment compelling is that Payoneer has been around for 15 years, which removes a fair amount of execution risk related to growth, i.e., the team knows what they're doing. The company is also investing in providing additional services for its customer base which should contribute to growth and strengthen its competitive position.

IMHO the key for the company (and the stock) is to better explain the customer ROI at the unit level and why investments now make sense from a CLTV sense. The company also needs to address flattish margins on 25% revenue growth and negative EBITDA after 15 years of operations. I think the company missed an excellent opportunity to frame the discussion out of the gate by highlighting the benefits of its scale with detailed customer metrics, e.g., subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), churn, and most importantly customer lifetime value (CLTV). These are really the metrics which matter to thoughtful investors as well as the usual financials. If this was an obvious play, it would be trading significantly higher. (Un)fortunately, most investors don't like complexity or have the patience to watch a good company become a great company. I think this may be a situation where really digging into the financials and business model could reward investors handsomely over time. That said, far more DD is needed as well as much more disclosure from the company before one can make a decision. I would encourage investors to take a modest position and then build on it as the DD validates.

The acquisition is expected to close within the first half of 2021 at which point detailed financials should be available.

**Company:** Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world. In 2020, the company recognized $345mn of revenue (31% Y/Y growth adjusted for the pandemic) on $44bn of transactions. The company was founded 15 years ago and operates in over 190 countries (basically the whole world).

**Customers:** Enterprises and SMB. The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network.

[This](https://mingclee.medium.com/payoneer-how-to-sustain-its-success-in-the-super-competitive-chinese-market-9b7eda21cf35) blog post does a nice job of discussing Payoneer's entry into China, which looks promising. My concern with China is exactly what's happening, namely, the competition is driving down the price. PayPal entered with a 5% fee and the industry is now around 1%. The post quotes  a VC who aptly sums up the situation:

&gt;[*You don’t have to be the first, but you need to be better, cheaper and faster.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkHJLVAM4A&amp;t=182s)

This dynamic obviously has margin implications  and also illustrates why higher-value services are important longer-term. Expect WorldFirst and AirWallex to continue to further drive this dynamic.

I need to comment on Payoneer's customer service, which based on a perusal of r/Payoneer leaves something to be desired. First, the Wirecard scandal caused Payoneer to move to an Ireland-based bank, which has pretty [onerous documentation requirements](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/ku38y4/whats_up_with_payoneer_recently/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Clearly this has [upset](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/j1e7n6/payoneer_is_a_shit_company_with_zero_customer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a fair amount of vendors. I have no idea how many were impacted as a % of the total customer base but enough to warrant attention. I'm hoping this is a [transitory issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/payoneer/comments/lbkz4x/this_platform_still_rocks_for_freelancers/gm1vukg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) but it obviously needs to be monitored. Second, the payments industry like the broadband industry is one in which if the service is not delivered seamlessly, customers will gripe to no end. (You hate your cable company but you NEED BB. You know it.) The only thing worse than BB latency is cash latency, i.e., a delay or freeze on your account. Clearly, the industry as a whole needs to do better. I can attest firsthand that vendor complaints about PayPal have reached a deafening level. However, as one disgruntled vendor notes, it's basically a two horse race. There is no third option. Assuming that's the case, I like Payoneer's position given its lower fees and better service on a relative basis than PayPal. Again, I want to see customer service scores moving in the right direction. No question. But the industry has come a long way from Western Union.

**Customer service.** After spending some time on the [r/Payoneer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payoneer/) sub-reddit, I have two initial impressions.

* While the Wirecard scandal caused a headache for Payoneer’s customers, it seems to be a transitory issue.
* The Wirecard scandal aside, Payoneer’s customer service is less than perfect and needs to improve. (Note: few people go out of their way to praise a bank or their cable company for seamlessly delivering the services the customers pay for. Please keep that in mind when browsing [r/Payoneer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Payoneer/).)

**User feedback.** I would very much like to thank [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/), who provided some really great insights into his experience using Payoneer as a vendor based in Europe.

* Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape.
* A lot of freelancers on [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that [Upwork.com](https://upwork.com/) can't wire money to.
* Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.
* Vendors can also pay suppliers directly through wire transfers and pay for services like hosting using the MasterCard. *However, customers can't fund their Payoneer account.* While Payoneer likes the reputation of being ""a U.S bank account"" they really are not. They are a service that allows you to receive payment from companies. While individuals can send money from and to other Payoneer accounts, wire transfers to the account can only be done by a business.
* As a result of the Wirecard scandal, Payoneer now gives customers the option to choose to hold their funds on their MasterCard or on Payoneer own accounts.
* From [u/-Jack-The-Lad](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Jack-The-Lad-/): “Overall I think Payoneer is a good company. They have a lot of room for expansion and their market is beyond huge. One thing I am concerned about is the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. As Payoneer grows, it will likely get noticed by countries and may face stricter regulations both in the U.S and abroad.”
* Fellow customer u/[tonysoleoptions](https://www.reddit.com/user/tonysoleoptions/) notes that Payoneer offers a no frills currency exchange service while is reliable and dependable. In terms of areas for improvement he cites the slower transaction times relative to PayPal and less than optimal reporting.  

**Industry and market opportunity:** B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics but the disclosure could have been better (more about that below). Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.)

**Management team and investor base:** Betsy Cohen led FTOC and has extensive expensive in the FinTech space, including leading previous SPACs and founding Bancorp Bank. Scott Galit has experience at MasterCard and First Data, which is exactly what you want to see.

As this [Barron's article](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/why-a-fintech-chose-to-go-public-with-a-spac-hint-its-the-money-and-the-partner-51612568216) notes (h/t  [whmcpanel](https://www.reddit.com/user/whmcpanel/)), unlike with an IPO, the sponsor and institutional investors get to look at the financials before making an investment decision. This is a crucial distinction for two reasons. First, you need to choose your SPAC carefully because you're relying on the sponsor to do thorough due diligence (DD). Second, if quality institutional investors participate, it generally means they like what they saw in their DD. On both accounts, Payoneer looks promising. Betsy Cohen is an industry leader in FinTech and Payoneer's institutional investor (II) base is high quality with IIs such as Dragoneer, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Millennium, T. Rowe, and Winslow Capital Management. Wellington Management, an existing investor, also participated. These are IIs who understand FinTech and like what they saw in their DD, which is an encouraging sign. 

**Business model:** Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth  per year for the next two years. I would say all else equal flat revenue growth vs. decelerating volume growth is a good thing but again a deeper dive into the product mix is necessary. The key here is that these growth rates are higher than the overall market so Payoneer appears to be taking share but again more DD is needed.

While the transaction margins have been growing, the company forecasted margins to remain flat at 72% for the next two years. I believe this forecast is due to a change in the blended take rate but unfortunately the company really didn’t elaborate here. I would have expected the revenue growth to drive some incremental margin expansion but I’m clearly missing a piece of the story. This may be an issue for investors. That said, the CFO offered long-terms targets of +20% revenue growth and +20% EBITDA margins. I was also surprised the company wasn't EBITDA positive given how long it's been around but I need to see how much of the costs were investment or subscriber acquisition related.

As for the all-important unit-economics, the customer payback period is less than 12 months, which is nice. Disclosing CLTV would have been better. The company also noted net volume retention (i.e., same store comparison of customer Y/Y volume) is over 100% but did not disclose exactly what the percentage is. This is somewhat irrelevant since anything less than 100% and the company wouldn't be getting acquired. I found the SMB cohort volume on slide 27 interesting. While it's lacking a Y-axis for volume (ugh!), it's clear each year's cohort of customers are roughly following a similar trajectory although 2015 seems to be a slight outlier. Now, if the company would just disclose the unit economics for these cohorts, you'd have your investment decision made. I think at this point, you have to trust the quality of FTOC and the II's DD. As I suggested above, my guess is that they drilled down pretty heavily and liked what they saw.

Finally, many are looking at Payoneer’s transaction fees to get a sense for the potential revenue opportunity. While this is logical, it is somewhat misleading because these services are considered low quality revenue as I note above (cf. the race to sub-1% fees in China). Similar to the CDN business, where moving traffic is a commodity while providing web acceleration and cloud security offer higher margins, Payoneer needs to upsell higher value added services to its customer base, which was initially attracted by the low service fees. Once again, Payoneer highlighted these value added services in its presentation

Note: the adjusted numbers were a turnoff. Covid happened. If you're benefitting from the acceleration in cross-border traffic due to the pandemic, don't exclude those sectors or markets negatively impacted by said pandemic. I believe the company was done a disservice by its bankers here in trying to manipulate the numbers. Investors aren't stupid and if they are, they're not the ones you want. This massaging of the numbers coupled with the lack of PF shares outstanding is a little concerning. It's early and the deal isn't completed yet so I'll give management the benefit of the doubt. For now.

**Valuation:** FinTech companies such as PayPal, Square, and Payoneer are valued on subscriber growth. The key metric which the analysts will judge the company on is customer lifetime value (CLTV), which is an NPV of the total cash flows from each customer over his/her/its lifetime. (Analysts apply a similar approach to wireless companies and data center REITs where each new subscriber or data center build is viewed on a payback and NPV basis. Technically, these companies are valued on earnings, EBITDA or AFFO but its CLTV or customer NPV which determines the valuation multiple.) Counterintuitively, once the company reaches a certain scale and growth slows, the margins and FCF will improve but the analysts will become concerned that growth is moderating even though the financials are improving. (That's when the smart money will bail.) Again, CLTV is the name of the game and is the primary way to evaluate companies such as Payoneer. There's a reason why the company included different cohort growth rates and mentioned a less than 12-month customer payback in the presentation. These are the metrics that matter.

Based on FTOC's current share price of \~$13.50, Payoneer's current market cap is roughly $6bn, which assumes \~430mn total shares outstanding.\* (This is a SWAG as management did not include a pro forma cap table with shares.) The current valuation implies an enterprise value (EV) to revenue multiple on 2021 revenue in the mid-teens, which is much closer to global payment processors such as First Data than digital payment and ecommerce companies such as PayPal, Square, and Shopify. FTOC shareholders will own 19.2% at closing. Finally, there is a management earn-out of 30 million shares at the $15 and $17 mark which will dilute existing FTOC shareholders but comes with 10-25% upside from current levels.

* The initial valuation assumed an enterprise value (EV) of $3.3 billion, which equates to 7.6x EV to 2021 revenue. Just to clarify, FTOC was negotiating a CASH investment, i.e., the $755mn raised at IPO and held in trust, not an acquisition with its shares as currency. FTOC's pro forma ownership of 19.2% for a $755mn equity investment roughly equates to the pro forma market cap of $3.8bn mentioned in the presentation. Yes, there is some dilution from the sponsor's promote and the 30m shares in earn-out but I would argue that FTOC got a fair price for its investment as evidenced by the fact that FTOC shares are trading +30% above NAV.

**Investment Thesis:**

1. **Majority of traffic stays within the network.** In my opinion, this is the key company metric because it reflects how valuable the network is to its customers. This metric continues to increase for Payoneer.
2. **Exposure to digital commerce and mobility trends.** As everyone realizes, this is a big and growing market which the pandemic accelerated.
3. **Global network provides network effects and is difficult to replicate.** The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.
4. **Playing the long game.** The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for. I can tell you based on several years in the VC industry that this is their number one issue. You have the funds for payroll but they're tied up in A/R. This is where Payoneer is currently focused and I think it will represent a significant competitive advantage relative to its competition. I would love to see Payoneer partner with an institution like SVB which caters to small and emerging companies. Expect M&amp;A to figure into the company’s strategic plans as well.
5. **Quality Sponsor and II's.** As I noted above, Payoneer has a blue chip II base who performed DD not available with an IPO. These IIs clearly liked what they saw. Investors should certainly do their own DD but note that there is some impressive names in the II base, which is encouraging.
6. **Attractive valuation.** Payoneer’s valuation is much closer to global payment processors than digital payment and ecommerce companies. The negative EBITDA, flattish transactional margins, and ""adjusted"" revenue are certainly issues and need to be addressed. However, as noted above, Payoneer needs to be viewed in the correct context to value it appropriately. While the company doesn't merit PayPal's multiple given it doesn't have its growth or scale (yet), the company is certainly benefitting from scale/ network effects and deserves a multiple which reflects this. I expect the valuation multiple to rise (or ""expand"" in WS parlance) as the business becomes better understood within the investment community and the company posts a few solid quarters of earnings results. I feel like this is more ""a when rather than if"" issue. Thus, the current valuation represents an attractive entry point for current investors.

**Risks:**

1. **Competition.** PayPal is a giant and only getting stronger as 4Q results testifies. The company has leveraged network scale effects to achieve a market cap rivaling MasterCard. Skrill is also well known in this space. MasterCard and Visa certainly play in cross border transactions but I don’t think they provide the level of services Payoneer does. Definitely need to do more DD here.
2. **Customer risk.** Related to the previous point, if Payoneer loses a large customer like AMZN, the stock will take a hit (cf AMEX walking away from CostCo).
3. **Regulatory.** Payoneer needs to navigate every country’s regulatory environment. The company has certainly done a good job but as the FAANGS can testify, the larger you get, the bigger target you become, e.g., Europe is trying to displace MA and V.
4. **Crypto currency.** At this point, everyone in FinTech better have a crypto currency strategy even if it's just allowing transactions in BTC. Crypto currency was made for seamless cross-border currency transactions which makes a crypto strategy doubly important for Payoneer.
5. **FX exposure.** I’m sure the company has a world class FX hedging team but I feel like this needs to be flagged given the scale of the business. Investors could unintentionally have FX exposure.

**TLDR:**  While the global B2B industry is fragmented, Payoneer is playing the long-game by transitioning from commodity service fees to high-touch and sticky value add services. The key metric analysts will focus on is CLTV which will benefit from the shift to these services. Moreover, Payoneer’s valuation multiple should reflect this transition by increasing (or “expanding” in WS parlance) as Payoneer executes on this strategy. I believe Payoneer will significantly reward LT investors at the current valuation with the caveat that far more DD is needed around competition and the financial model. I also would not be surprised if PayPal took them out given their $6bn market cap vs. PayPal's +$300bn. It would be a very nice complement to PayPal's existing business assuming the transaction past regulatory scrutiny. My advice is to spend more time digging and in the meantime acquire a small position upon which to build.

Six months ago I came across REIT that was absolutely crushed by the pandemic. Most of their revenue came from two major tenants that stopped paying rent, so as you'd expect their stock plummeted and were forced to slash dividends. 

**Quick Background:**

Their asset Pinedale was leased by UPL but as bankruptcy proceedings threated to terminate the lease CORR decided to sell pinedale to UPL for $18MM. Pinedale at the time consisted of \~26% of CorEnergy's total assets and \~31% of its total revenue in 2019. 

Second tenant is Energy XXI GIGS Services LLC who was leasing the GIGS pipeline. GIGS consisted of \~32% of their Total Assets and \~47% of their Total Revenue. Lawsuit was in full swing to try and recover past due rent.

**Crimson California Pipeline deal:**

I don't normally invest in Micro caps but CORR stayed on my radar. The potential acquisition of another income producing asset and the on-going lawsuit with Energy XXI kept me tuned and I wanted to see if management could locate a great deal and recoup some of the past due rent.

Today CORR announced their ""secret"" acquisition they've been working on for months. After reading through the press release, the current management team looks like they got absolutely fleeced. Below is a snapshot of the so-called Deal. Keep in mind this management team bought GIGS 5 years ago for **$245m**.

**Crimson Midstream Holdings Deal Overview:**

\- **Total Deal Value**: $350m

**CORR Financing:**

\- $75.6m in cash  
\- $105m in a new loans  
\- $120m in equity dilution

All of the above is a steep price to pay given how small and desperate they are to resume paying adequate dividends; however, it also mentions ""contribution of the Grand Isle Gathering System (GIGS) to the sellers"". Yeah, you read that right.. The Total deal is valued for $350MM, UPL owes them at least $20m; therefore, they are essentially selling GIGS for $30m when they bought this asset only 5 years ago for $245m..   


The Crimson asset is looking to add an annual run rate EBITDA at \~$50m, which prior to COVID was in the ballpark of what GIGS was currently producing.. I was hoping I misread that press release but after going to other websites and articles, it appears others are drawing a similar conclusion.

**My thoughts:**  


This was a major let down given the speculative possibilities that were floating around. Fortunately, there is conference call tomorrow at 10AM EST. Only then we can get more info around this deal. 

If the deal is what I think it is then the only potential positive outcome is John Grier (founder and Board chairman of Crimson Midstream) will become the new COO and join the Board of Directors of CorEnergy along with Robert Waldron (CFO at Crimson) who will step in as the new CFO. 

I haven't been able to dig much into John Grier and Robert Waldron yet but with recent history, any shake up to the current management team is a good thing.

Livent is scheduled due to report 4Q earnings on February 20th.

**Investment Thesis**

Livent’s primary source of revenue is lithium, a key component for electric batteries. Livent is one of the five major suppliers of lithium worldwide and the only pure-play provider in North America. We view Livent as well positioned to leverage the global transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric vehicles (EV), due to its significant technology expertise, global supply chain, and partnerships with OEMs, including Tesla. Hence, Livent’s premium valuation accurately reflects the company’s ability to gain share in a growing market driven by a favorable regulatory environment and an increasing sense of corporate responsibility.

**Key Catalysts:**

\- *Favorable regulatory environment will drive EV adoption.* China is the largest and fastest growing market for EVs, followed by Europe. China recently extended tax exemptions for EVs while Europe enacted the European Climate Law with the goal of making Europe climate neutral by 2050. We expect the Biden administration to pursue similar policies, albeit of a more incremental nature. Additionally, corporations are increasingly adopting energy efficient targets as part of a greater awareness of their social responsibility. We view the favorable regulatory environment as the primary catalyst for EV adoption and one that is largely sustainable regardless of political and social changes.

\- *Livent is well positioned to leverage the growing market for nickel-rich batteries.* Within the electric battery market, nickel-rich batteries are generally preferred for high performance EVs. Nickel-rich batteries require lithium hydroxide, which Livent produces through a two-stage chemical process. Livent estimates the market share for nickel-rich batteries should increase from about 25% today to 75% by the end of the decade.

\- *Recent demand uptick suggests pricing likely to recover.* Lithium pricing had been under pressure due to a supply glut heading into 2020 which the pandemic exacerbated by reducing demand. (Lithium pricing contracts are long-term although lithium carbonate pricing has declined more than 50% since the beginning of the pandemic.) Industry experts currently estimate lithium pricing needs to rise by roughly 10% to incentivize suppliers to expand capacity. We believe this scenario is likely to occur given some recent encouraging signs, including robust October sales of EVs in China and Europe.

\- *Scale and Argentina operations offer relative cost advantage.* Regardless of the trajectory of the pricing rebound, however, Livent has a relative cost advantage due to its brine-based Argentina mine, which is more cost efficient than spodumene mines [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1). Additionally, Livent is vertically integrated enabling it to capture value along every step of the supply chain. Longer-term, lithium suppliers are pursuing alternatives such as the potential to mine lithium from clay and recycling existing batteries to insulate margins from global disruptions. Although supply may eventually be impacted by new entrants such as Bolivia and India, there are significant political and logistical hurdles which will need to be overcome.

**Company Description**

Livent is a pure play lithium company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA. The company went public in 2018 as a spin-off from FMC Corporation. Livent extracts lithium from its plant in Argentina and then converts the metal into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, which are the critical components for electric batteries. Analysts forecast Livent to generate $400mn in revenue in 2021 and EBITDA margins in the high-teens.

Livent recently extended its supply agreement with Tesla through 2021. We expect this contract to be renewed past the current term. Livent also entered into a joint venture with private equity firm Pallinghurst Resources to buy Canada's lithium projects, which are spodumene based. Through the JV, New Nemaska Lithium, Livent will own 25% of the economics, which should provide economies of scale for its North American operations.

**Industry and Market Opportunity**

Lithium is an alkali metal found in natural substances such as rocks. Lithium is extremely light, a property which makes it ideal for storing energy. In its pure form, lithium actually has an energy density equivalent to gasoline although a typical EV car battery has a much lower density due to the additional inputs required such as casings and electrolyte fluid. In addition to Livent, there are four other global players of which Livent is one of only two providers in North America.

The lithium opportunity is primarily tied to growth in electric batteries although grid storage is emerging as a secondary use case. (Despite the attention paid to electric cars, electric buses are actually further along the adoption curve due to scale benefits.) Battery sales accounted for 65% of global lithium demand in 2019 and analysts are forecasting this percentage to continue to rise steadily. Given lithium is a commodity, the only limiting supply factor is a price high enough to warrant mining. A third party research firm, Fortune Business Insights, estimates that the global [lithium market](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rnOqyS-E5qWpEUFLoMeh3w3gSgw-u8NK1t-DXVE8CZI_qSX_FG7DaFbNfwOY1GCj8-hZsRn-ezuSitWBnrb4WpkSApmUiWBUpkd_X_Ms4WGIMiFgBeI_XOUAv_u0vuyiAnFinChKftDQSSS8I1GZbg==) opportunity will reach $8.24 billion by the end of 2027, up from $4.1 billion in 2019 (9.2% CAGR) while demand is expected to increase almost tenfold over the next decade.

Deloitte and IHS Markit forecast EVs to account for approximately 30% of total passenger car and light duty vehicles by 2030.

**Financials and Valuation**

Approximately 80% of Livent’s revenue is generated from sales of battery-grade lithium hydroxide and butyllithium. Energy storage is the primary use case for Livent’s batteries, including rechargeable batteries for EVs, portable electronics and grid storage systems. Approximately 65% of Livent’s sales are from Asia, followed by North America (20%) and Europe (15%).

3Q review: Revenue improved sequentially as demand slowly returned although margins and Adjusted EPS missed consensus due to COVID-related costs. The company did not provide 4Q guidance although management noted volumes should continue to improve.

4Q and 2021 Outlook: Industry experts were originally forecasting a flattish year for global lithium demand but have since revised their 2020 estimates upward to reflect an uptick in EV sales late this year. Hence, we believe there is upside to 4Q consensus. For 2021, analysts are forecasting revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million and $75 million, respectively. Given the required capacity demands, Livent is not expected to be cash-flow positive for the foreseeable future.

[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftnref1) It is generally more cost efficient to extract lithium brine than pegmatite due to logistics, topography, and climate.

Holding is not a bad idea granted you could actually afford to which is what I feel people missed out on.

The point is, it wasn't completely horrible to get involved because truly, hindsight is 20/20 for situations like this. This was an unprecedented event in the likes the world has literally never seen. How could you possibly have predicted it to the tee? You can't pretend like you're the smartest in the room that saw all this coming. You can only extrapolate the data as it comes and watch as the event unfolds.

I'd say you can call it more of a gamble than an investment, but it doesn't take a genius to understand that when getting in. The fact is, expectations should have been set better for all the new people that joined.

Like I said earlier, the only people to worry about are the ones who truly have lost a majority of their wealth from this. I'm all about the movement but realistically if I invested at the starting price before it spiked to $400, I probably would've sold enough to cover my initial investment and kept the rest to be a part of the movement.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Lives Have Been Destroyed... Let's not deny it**

There are some people here that really went all out. Like I don't know if you've been paying attention, but I've seen it on blogs, on many subreddits, on social media. Some people really have gone ALL OUT or have thrown a majority of their wealth on this.

If this is the case, I'd start talking to a financial advisor immediately about what your next steps are. My deepest sympathies go out to the guys and gals who are feeling breathless and suffocated in these times, that in it of itself has been giving me more anxiety than anything else. Just looking at all the people who put in way more than they could chew... it honestly destroys me. I have anxiety myself and I can't imagine what you people are going through right now.

I can see people hurting themselves over the decisions that have been made in the past 2 weeks. Especially with the pandemic at an all time high and already causing mental health ruin, this does not help.

For the people that feel destroyed - you are going to get through this. I know it really sucks but you will. Life can change at an instant at any second the same way it can go to shit. The same way you feel you're never going to find that person to fall in love with and the next second some gorgeous girl is going out with your ugly bum. In either case, little by little, you'll fix this and you'll have become stronger for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Upside and Lessons**

On the flip side, I and I'm sure many have had and are having a lot fun being a part of this movement. I hope this was a valuable lesson to many who had thrown everything in to not let emotions get in the way of making smart investment decisions.

This was a volatile market, and should have come in understanding that this was basically gambling money as much as it was an attempt at a short-term investment. Going forward, if you decide to stick around and invest in the stock market in general, it really can be an enjoyable experience to play with the numbers in a way that doesn't get your heart dropping every 2 seconds.

If any of you need to talk or are feeling low, the PMs are open, and I'm sure there are many people that can and will help you get through this.

**Closing thoughts... hold if you can afford it and have been in it for the movement. But don't have any expectations of this giving any real returns going forward.**"|investing|To All Sufferers of the Whole Fiasco - Mental Health &amp; Recovery|463.0|0.89

Thank you for taking the time to look over this and give your opinion on the subject matter.

I was building my portfolio and trying to decide between a more heavy ""growth"" TSMC VS a ""value"" Intel. I'm bullish on the whole semiconductor industry but get is to splitting hairs between the two largest chipmakers.  This choice was simpler before Intels new CEO brought back a renewed vigor in manufacturing and Development,

Looking at the balance sheets and market parameters.  I would say TSMC has the advantage in the market cap of ""608 B"" and Growth projections of ""10-15%"" vs Intel's advantage dividend yield ""2.51%"" and Free cash flow of ""20B"".

I work in the engineering department for a city of roughly 120,000 people and like the rest of country, the infrastructure that was constructed 50+ years ago is starting to degrade and need replacing. One of the most important parts of any system is how it can convey water to the outfall during rain events. Back in the day, the pipes used for storm water were made of concrete. Sure, they are very strong, and if constructed right, will last a while. We have a 72” line that was constructed in 1927 and is mainly in good condition. 

Unfortunately, these concrete pipes are falling apart nowadays. So, instead of replacing them with the same material pipe, we were introduced to ADS, a company that specializes in polypropylene pipes. It’s essentially a very durable plastic that can last much longer to concrete when constructed properly. I can go into much more technical details such as the fact that ADS pipes come in 20ft sections instead of 8 ft sections like concrete, reducing the number of joints, which reduces the number of areas that can fail. Or the fact that it takes only 2-4 men to lift an WMS pipe compared to having an excavator lift a concrete pipe. 

There a number of advantages. Over the past year, the price has gone up $61.00. This is just my opinion on the company and would like to hear what you guys have to say."|investing|Advanced Drainage Systems (WMS)|15.0|0.83

Overall, this company hits my 4 big checks 

1. Founders are still operating the business with conviction
2. They have a clear mission &amp; vision to improve the world with strong conviction 
3. The company's focus is product obsession
4. The company can last longer than 2.5 years running at a loss &amp; is recession resistant (this would be better if it would benefit in a recession).


**Financial Health**

The company consistantly has 68-75% gross margin. They have 3x current assets to current liabilities and can run for 4 years given 2020's burn rate. This is impressive considering that COVID-19 fucked the world. The company reached profitability 1 qtr earlier than expected &amp; did it during a global pandemic. The company also has 25% liabilities to assets. 

Compared to ALGN there is a lot of upside. ALGN has 1.3 B in sales &amp; is trading at 19.5x sales. SDC is 670 M in sales &amp; is at ~8.5x sales. With a 31.8% short float with an average cost of &lt; $11. A squeeze is in the making come earnings on Feb 22nd. 


**Bull Case **

SDC can increase club members through using teeth whitening &amp; multichannel (destist, retail, smile shops, mobile app, &amp; web) to get corrective straighteners. International expansion &amp; improving capture in the U.S. will turn the company to profitability. 

On top of that the company plans on expanding into other products lines such as teeth whitening &amp; hardcore orthodontics applications. 

**Bear Case** 

The company's products do not work as advertised. The customer satisfaction ratings are over inflated due to strict NDA's for refunds. The results are worse than expected &amp; FDA plus state regulatory agencies will require dental professionals ruining the teledentist model in person as a result. This is a fad that will die. 

NYT Article It Has A Few Valid Points But It's Mainly FUD - published Q1 2020
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/technology/smiledirectclub-smile-nda.amp.html 

Valid Point: SDC is a general solution that occasionally screws up edges cases where the consumer has problems beyond the products abilities. This is a defining attribute to their business model &amp; as a result the company requires NDA's for refunds. 


**Bear Case Flaws** 

There are roughly ~780,000 known successful cases and 2,900 known BBB complaints. That's ~2% dissatisfaction rate. This rate is much higher than ALGN &amp; is because the SDC allows consumers to do a fiting at home &amp; consumers don't understand the limitations of SDC's product relative to their condition. 

The company has responded beautifully through encouraging customers to go to partnered dental professionals &amp; has had +70% of customers take this route. As you can see on their BBB page all 2,900 customer complaints have been addressed and the few class action lawsuits that I could find were shut down by the company's terms &amp; conditions. 

In the Q3 earnings call the CEO &amp; founder addresses this problem directly &amp; states that the company has built the multichannel sales network to support any consumers path (mold, dentist, web, mobile app, or smile direct center). 

State regulators do not care because the end result of a customer using the product the wrong way is an open bite. Plus the company recommends going to dental professionals in their network &amp; warns the consumer about the risks ahead of time.

BBB Complaints - 

https://www.bbb.org/us/tn/nashville/profile/cosmetic-dentistry/smiledirectclub-0573-37111672/complaints


**Bull Case**

The CEO &amp; founders are the most excited &amp; invested in the following domestically &amp; internationally. As a result they have offered 350 M in convertible notes at a price target of mind twenties 24 or 26 (I can't remember) exp 2026. 

Plus sales can only improve from here because we are on the upside of COVID. 

Whitening products are in CVS, Wall Greens, &amp; are being piolated in 300 Wal-Marts. This is the funneling strategy for more long term customers. 

**Time Herizon &amp; The Trade**

Given today's movement there is a short term sell off. A price below 11.10 is a good price &amp; hold for 2 years. This qtr alone there is a 30% upside in the stock. Anything below 10.00 is a steal. Sense earnings has the potiential to be a second profitable qtr short term options plays exist. 

I plan on buying March 19 calls 2 weeks prior to earnings 3.5 bucks OTM.  


There is a 2.5x upside in valuation alone at current sales. Long term there is a 4.5x - 5x opportunity at maturity. I am holding stock at $12.90. 


**Economic Moat**
After some digging their economic moat is similar to what we see in software. The company relies on speed to market, network connections, &amp; the patent system to slow others down or block out the competition. After reading the patent abstracts the patents are wide enough to cause a legal basis for litigation even if it's on frivolous claims for every aspect of their business from replicating the process Tele Medicine all the way down to the imaging tech &amp; manufacturing capabilities. For perspective a cheap patent litigation attorney costs 1,100 per hour and you would need a team of 5 to 7. An in-house patent team would cost 1.5 M to 2 M annually on the low end. 

Overall, there is not a specific set of tech that blocks out others ... however, the combination of speed, manufacturing ability, patent trolling, and establishing a network of dental professionals creates a significant barrier of entry. If another startup or incumbent were to pivot into the space they would have to beat the price, experience, &amp; speed of service by atleast 1.75x to justify an upset.

1612482257.0|0.0|t3_lctrib|18.0|"I’ve been working on some sexy DD for $MARA. Mara lovely Mara.

Let’s get right into it.

# What is MARA?

MARA stands for Marathon Patent Group. Yes, you read that correctly. Now, you may be asking yourself “is this dude telling me to invest in a fucking patent troll?” Yes and no. First of all, this isn’t a patent troll, and second, Mara mines bitcoin. If you’re familiar with bitcoin mining, then you may have heard of RIOT. That is what I will be comparing Mara to today.

Now, this is an extremely risky investment. Mara has a ton to prove, but if they keep up to their contracts, this is gonna be insane growth.

Let’s get to it.

With 103,060 miners ordered and contracted with Bitmain, Mara plans to be the biggest bitcoin mining facility in North America by Q1 2022. This represents 6.4% of the global bitcoin hash rate and will produce about 55-60 bitcoin per day. Both Mara and Riot use [Bitmain Antminer S19s](https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020201222165500548JAa69Gvu067A), which mine at a hash rate of 110 TH/s at the pro version. Now, mining *can* be profitable, however, it depends on a few factors. These factors include the cost of electricity, difficulty rate of mining bitcoin, price of bitcoin, price of miners, etc. The lower the cost of electricity and miners, the more revenue possible. Many seem to believe that mining will stop being profitable over time, specifically as difficulty rates become harder and harder. That’s true depending on the level. If a company is able to keep their electricity costs low, and the mining hash rate high, then the profits will come in. Especially if they have a massive rig. (100k miners is FUCKING massive btw)

# Exposure to Bitcoin

Mara two weeks ago [invested in themselves](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1224/marathon-invests-150-million-in-bitcoin) by purchasing 4,812.66 bitcoin at a price of about $150 million. That means they purchased these at an average of $31,167 per bitcoin. What a fucking play. They perfectly timed the recent dip. So in literally two weeks, that $150 million is now worth $180 million. $30 million in profit just like that. This purchase also helps Marathon accelerate the process of being tied to bitcoin closely.

# Contracts/Partnerships

**Bitmain**

Bitmain is a business based in Beijing, China that designs and builds application-specific integrated chip circuits for bitcoin mining. Bitmain is an incredible partner and will support Mara as they build to become one of the largest and most efficient miners in North America. In December, Mara [announced](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1218/marathon-patent-group-purchases-70000-s-19-asic-miners) the largest order that Bitmain has ever received. 70,000 S-19 ASIC miners at a total cost of $168,000,000. This order brings Mara at a total of 103,060 miners, with planned deployment by Q1 2022. These miners will be shipped out on a monthly basis to Mara. [4 days ago](https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1226/bitmain-ships-4000-antminer-s-19-pro-asic-miners-to) Bitmain shipped 4,000 S-19 miners from a previous order in which Mara expects to have all 4,000 miners fully deployed by the end of this month, February. This will increase Mara’s total miners to 6,560 from 2,560. This shipment is only the first of the many shipments that Mara expects to receive from Bitmain in the entirety of 2021. Mara anticipates another 6,300 miners in March and 4,800 in April, putting them at a total of 17,660 miners by May 1st.

**Beowulf Energy**

Beowulf Energy is a private business that develops and operates power generation worldwide. As of today, Beowulf owns and manages over 2.3 GW of power generation capacity worldwide. Mara holds a partnership with Beowulf Energy to receive a supply of consistent low-cost electricity at a fixed rate of $0.028/kWh. This decreases a lot of risks as Mara will have access to consistent power at a fixed price, meaning that over time, mining margins will be consistent and increase minimally. This also increases Mara’s profitability as the average price of electricity in the US is over $0.08/kWh. Beowulf Energy also owns 6 million shares of Marathon, which means Beowulf will always have Mara’s best interests in mind. At this electricity cost, Marathon expects every single bitcoin mined to cost about $4,500/bitcoin\* once the full rig is deployed. (\*This is calculated using January 2020 bitcoin mining difficulty.) Assuming the cost of bitcoin is just $30,000/bitcoin, which’s about $50 million in revenue per month and $43.6 million in gross profit per month for Mara. This means that if the price of bitcoin continues in an upward trend, then profits for Mara will literally multiply. Insane.

Now for the good stuff. Let’s get into the numbers and potential profit here. First, I want to compare Mara to Riot in the short term and long term as they are two head to head companies competing in the bitcoin mining territory. As of right now, both companies trade almost identically, although Mara’s market cap is 1.95 Billion and Riot’s is 1.45 Billion. I see Mara blowing past Riot in the near future.

# Key Dates/Timeline

Marathon’s current mining fleet consists of 2,560 miners, generating 248 PH/s, or .24 EH/s. Remember when I talked about Mara’s expected shipments in the next few months? That’s gonna come in handy here. Here are some key dates I’ve compiled for Mara.

**2,560 Miners (248 PH/s) as of February 1st**

*On pending order: 93,520 miners remaining*

\+4,000 (+440 PH/s) - End of February - expects 688 PH/s (.68 EH/s)

\+6,300 (+693 PH/s) - End of March - expects 1381 PH/s (1.38 EH/s)

\+4,800 (+528 PH/s) - End of April - expects 1909 PH/s (1.9 EH/s)

**Expected 17,660 (1,909 PH/s) Miners as of May 1st**

*On pending order: 88,020 miners remaining*

As of today, Mara has about 2,560 miners set up and expects 17,660 miners by the beginning of May, which in theory should put their hash rate at 1.9 EH/s as of May 1st.

Mara expects to go from 2,560 miners to 17,660 which is an increase of 1.6 EH/s at a total of 1.9 EH/s

\-------------------------

**Now for Riot...**

**7,040 (567 PH/s) as of February 1st**

*On pending order: 30,600 miners remaining*

\+2500 (+275 PH/s) Beginning of February - expects 842 PH/s (.84 EH/s)

\+5500 (+605 PH/s) End of May - expects 1446 PH/s (1.45 EH/s)

**Expected 15,040 (1,446 PH/s) Miners as of May 1st**

*On pending order: 22,600 miners remaining*

As of today, Riot currently has about 9,540 miners set up and expects 15,040 miners by the beginning of May, which in theory should put their hash rate at 1.45 EH/s as of May 1st. Riot expects to go from 7,040 miners to 15,040 which is an increase of .89 EH/s at a total of 1.45 EH/s

That’s just short term too. If we look at the longer-term data we currently have, **by Q1 2022**, Mara expects 103,060 (10.36 EH/s) miners producing 55-60 bitcoin per day at a cost of $4,541/bitcoin (assuming today’s difficulty rates). **By October 2021**, Riot only expects 37,640 (3.8 EH/s) miners. That’s an insane difference by the beginning of next year. That means Mara will have a 6.56 EH/s edge on Riot which is fucking massive and will shoot Mara past Riot by a landslide.

Anyways, I’m getting pretty tired and I want to post this today as there’s an insane buying opportunity tomorrow morning as the dip today was massive. There’s so much more information about this and so much more I want to talk about. I encourage everyone to do some DD and decide for themselves, but the factors I’ve talked about are the main driving factors in my investment. To sum it up, Mara is hoping for 55-60 daily bitcoin production in Q1 2022 which will result in $60.1 million in revenue a month assuming bitcoin is worth $35,000/bitcoin. This is an insane opportunity for anyone here that is bullish on bitcoin and wants to put in some risk for some insane growth potential here. I encourage everyone to at least take a look at Marathon’s [presentation](https://content.equisolve.net/_16b475e371012841e1a1decd3e626707/marathonpg/db/184/3127/pdf/MARA+IR+Presentation+-+January+2021.pdf).

# This is probably the most important part of the DD.

So putting it all together… we can find the sum of the parts (SOTP). [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/big-picture-mara-stock-could-easily-double/) article is a good read and I’ll sum it up here:

[This](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/92378/nasdaq-marathon-patent-group-buys-bitcoin-btc-treasury-reserves) article gives us a good estimate to find the SOTP. In the article, it is mentioned that Marathon still has another $100 million from the $250 million recently raised, along with the $450 million in other cash according to their books. So adding it all together, we have $180 million in bitcoin plus $550 million in cash, bringing in a total of $730 million in total. This doesn’t even include the value of Mara’s bitcoin operation either, and considering the recent contract with Bitmain, Mara is expected to be one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in the world. If we want to value the operation, we can do so pretty easily. If we assume production of 55-60 bitcoin per day, that’s about $2 million at current prices per day. If we add on the electricity costs of $0.028/kWh, that brings us down to the cost of about $4,500 per bitcoin mined. This means that the gross operating margin will be about $1.75 million per day. If the price of bitcoin rises, this will increase the margins significantly as well. **That means if we get what we want, then Mara will run a rate of $631.9 million gross profits a year.** At a 5% operating cost (Mara only has 3 employees), we can assume a $600 million in free cash flow. At 20% net tax, the net income will be $480 million annually, and at just six times earnings Mara stock would be worth $2.88 billion alone. Adding in the SOTP value, the stock market cap is worth $3.63 billion. That’s almost double the current market cap of $1.95 billion. Also, the market can easily value the mining operation at 5x or 10x multiples. The sky is literally the limit here.

**Basically, Mara is worth at least 90% more than its current $23 price, and potentially substantially more depending on what the market will value. And if bitcoin keeps on rising (which is likely), both Mara’s crypto holdings and gross margins will multiply. I am extremely bullish on Mara and expect it to pump an insane amount.**

My price target is $50 per share in about 6 or so months (This is a pretty damn conservative target as well).

That combined with crippling debt and a heavy investment into sectors that were ""old technology"" pretty much poised them as a failing company. HOWEVER, there is stability and a massive change of direction for G.E. in these last few years. They are focusing on new and fresh ideas and sectors of the market. I am mad bullish on G.E. I think they are currently fairly valued... but theres potential! After COVID with aviation and with Joe Biden's green energy plan being implemented it is going to become a massive force. I think they are healthy after divesting themselves from ""less important"" future assets, pulling in a decent chunk of capital, began paying down huge chunks of debt, and changing direction to a more future ""relevant"" selection of sectors. I think aviation and green energy are going to continue to boom, and now that G.E. has built itself larger roots in those sectors I think they will be along for the ride.

Are they going to explode? Probably not. I don't think they are going to leap from $10 to $100 in the next year. But I think in the next 5 we might see them double, maybe even triple if they keep the direction and focus they have been showing. I think their earnings reports might scare people away, but I think if you look at the overall direction there is MASSIVE potential.

That is just my two cents and I am here for the conversation so if you would like to discuss this, please message me in the comments. If I am wrong I would love to know."|investing|Here is why I am bullish on G.E.|13.0|0.75

It trades on NASDAQ under the ticker $SABR and currently has a share price of $12.73 with a market cap of $4.04 billion. Sabre holds the number-two share of global distribution system air bookings (38.8% as of the end of 2019 versus 37.1% in 2018). The global distribution system segment represented 73% of total 2019 revenue. The company also has a growing IT solutions division (27% of revenue) that focuses on the airline, hospitality, and travel agent end markets. Transaction fees, which are tied to volume and not price, account for the bulk of revenue and profits. Beyond just being a good short squeeze opportunity, I think this company has potential to be a great long-term hold given its trading at ~45% bellow COVID-19 highs.


Thesis 1) Potential Short Squeeze Opportunity:

Keeping with our current theme, the biggest catalyst Sabre has is the fact that it currently has a 19.45% short interest. It has 274,710,000 shares outstanding with 61,700,000 shares being shorted. Due to its moderate volume, the short interest ratio / days to cover is 7 days making it a prime candidate for a short squeeze. Given some positive catalysts such as their recently announced Google Partnership as well as the fast vaccination rollout in the U.S., I think now is an excellent time to start buying the stock.


Thesis 2) Newly Forged Google Partnership:

On January 21, Google Cloud announced it has joined forces with Sabre Corporation to help digitally transform the traveler’s experience and co-create the future of travel. The 10-year-strategic partnership between Google and Sabre will enable the travel provider to improve operational agility while developing new services and creating a new marketplace for its airline, hospitality and travel agency customers. I think this a great initiative from management and the company, and it will reap the benefits from this partnership. 

• Improving Sabre’s technology capability: Sabre will begin the process of migrating its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud’s highly available and secure services. The partnership provides Sabre advanced support and greater flexibility to meet its technology objectives. 

• Using Google Cloud tools to enhance and optimize travel: Google Cloud’s data analytics tools will enable Sabre to enhance the capabilities of current and future products. They will provide Sabre with insights to help them improve operational efficiency and create and optimize travel options, improving both loyalty and revenues for its customers. 

• Driving a broader innovation framework: The two companies have aligned upon a framework that leverages talent and assets of both companies to imagine, develop and deploy future capabilities that will advance the travel ecosystem, benefiting all market participants.


Thesis 3) Vaccination Roll-Out:

Finally, travel should recover to pre-COVID levels once vaccines are rolled-out. Luckily for America, it has been doing a pretty good job at it. In the U.S., more Americans have now received at least one dose than have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began. So far, 35 million doses have been given, according to a state-by-state tally. In the last week, an average of 1.34 million doses per day were administered. In the U.S., the latest vaccination rate is 1,335,310 doses per day, on average. At this rate, it will take 11 months to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose vaccine. All in all, before the year is out we should see a meaningful progress towards achieving full immunity which means we can go back to travelling! This increase in travel will obviously benefit Sabre as well as the broader airline and travel adjacent industries.


In conclusion, I think now is a great opportunity to pick up some Sabre shares which is a fundamentally strong business that is trading at a steep discount (deep value anyone?). It has several favorable catalysts that will help share prices in the short term while also being a great long-term holding due the fundamental strength of the business. I’m long

**Introduction**

This is one of my favorite crypto projects. I believe HNS will be one of the foundational pillars of the decentralized web. If you have any reservations about if the decentralized web will actually happen just look at the incidents in the past couple of months. Decentralization and censorship proof solutions are the future.

**What is the Handshake Protocol?**

Handshake is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol where every peer is validating and in charge of managing the root DNS naming zone with the goal of creating an alternative to existing Certificate Authorities and naming systems. Names on the internet (top-level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system that is relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. Handshake aims to experiment with new ways the internet can be more secure, resilient, and socially useful with a peer-to-peer system validated by the network's participants.

Handshake is essentially a **base layer for the decentralized internet**. The internet is arranged in layers, to decentralize the internet, HNS is starting at the lowest layers of the stack. Secure naming ensures user agents are talking to the right endpoints.

Traditional top-level domains like .com are already one of the most valuable pieces of digital real estate available. HNS names will be the de facto way we navigate the decentralized web and give people an opportunity to actually own their own names across the web.

[handshake.org](https://handshake.org/)

**Institutional Investors**

**Handshake** raised $10.2 million from a group of venture funds and individuals, including **a16z, Founders Fund, Polychain Capital, and Draper Associates**. These **investors** purchased the rights to 7.5% of the initial HNS supply, pricing pre-launch tokens at $0.10 and valuing the network at $136 million.

Also, **Coinbase** reportedly invested in [Namebase.io](https://namebase.io/) an easy to use HNS domain registrar built on top of the protocol.

**Closing Statement**

Dweb will be the next evolution of crypto and unlike many projects, it will directly affect the lives of the average person. HNS will likely be one of the main pillars on which this new internet will stand. It is only a matter of time until this change happens and $HNS is thrust into the public eye. As for the future market cap of the coin I will not speculate. But if they are able to cement themselves as a foundational pillar of the defacto new internet the upside will be huge.

CSE: TNY

OTC: TNYBF

The TLDR:  Tinley is a combination US &amp; Canadian cannabis beverage play, while simultaneously attacking the zero alcohol category with the same drink minus the THC.  On top of their own brands, Tinley is securing revenue at their industry leading California bottling facility using it as a platform for other companies that want to tap into the THC beverage market.  Tinleys is an acquisition target for big alcohol or bigger THC companies looking to get into beverages.  Valued at only $50M, there is a lot of room to grow considering the exit valuations of other successful startup beverage brands, and existing THC beverage partnerships.

Why Beverages?

* Raw leaf is a commodity that when competition increases usually ends up with profit margins racing to the bottom.  Final products like beverages hold brand value which allow them to maintain high profit margins.  Humans consume beverages socially, and the fact that thc has a similar effect as alcohol but without the calories or hangover, it is very likely to replace a decent % of the alcohol industry, especially for people who have to go in to work the next morning.

On their leadership team, Tinley has a lineup of former executives from massively successful brands. Their roster is deeper than your wife’s boyfriend’s favourite sports team.

**Tinley’s THC line:**

They are now licensed to [bottle &amp; sell THC beverages in California](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/02/2056890/0/en/Tinley-s-Long-Beach-Facility-Receives-Cannabis-Manufacturing-License.html?fbclid=IwAR0IKVpZKV3irhZNwA9sFkSW85r9swPM2a5iPJo9VzBesRo0gnHqr6cNHa0), and have already applied to Health Canada for their license to do the same in Canada.  They also have plans to expand to Nevada in the medium term.

The drinks have [great reviews](https://growthbuster.com/blogs/liftoff/we-tried-8-non-alcoholic-cocktails-for-dry-january-here-s-what-happened?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-growthbuster&amp;utm_content=later-13990246&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=instagram&amp;fbclid=IwAR39Fb_lgTw99jysHAlabF-vEIOX9i1_RMP_Twob7vbKdIKCKA-sBuPrZBU), and apparently taste amazing, having [already won awards](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/17/1961810/0/en/Tinley-Takes-Top-Two-Infused-Beverage-Prizes-at-Emerald-Cup.html).

They use a Sativa strain which supposedly gives you a more uplifting euphoric feeling, rather than a glued-to-the-couch feeling.  I haven’t tried it myself, but the reviews online all seem positive.

Without speculating why, research suggests that people are moving away from alcohol over time.  On the other hand, cannabis use grows &amp; many experts believe that THC beverages will make up a large % of the total Cannabis market share.

“Molson president and CEO Mark Hunter told analysts that although it's difficult to provide a number because cannabis beverages were illegal at the time, he believed the total cannabis market in Canada to be about $7 billion to $10 billion in size, with beverages accounting for anywhere from 20% to 30% of the total, or as much as $3 billion. Even on the low end that's a $1.5 billion opportunity.”

Big companies have already made bets on this, like [Constellation Brands taking a 4 Billion stake in Canopy Growth Corp](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/05/05/Constellation-Brands-increases-stake-in-Canopy-Growth-Corp#:~:text=Constellation%20Brands%20has%20increased%20its,Canopy%20Growth%20Corp%20to%2038.6%25.) to develop THC beverages and [Molson Coors starting a joint venture with Hexo.](https://mjbizdaily.com/hexo-molson-coors-launch-truss-cannabis-beverage-portfolio/) [AB InBev &amp; Tilray invested $100 million Joint Venture into THC beverages](https://www.fooddive.com/news/ab-inbev-and-tilray-invest-100m-to-study-cannabis-based-drinks/544836/) creating the Fluent Beverage Company.

**Tinley’s non-infused non-alcoholic Beckett’s line:**

Their non-infused, non-alcoholic brand “Becketts” is currently in the trial phase in Costco, BevMo, Ralphs &amp; Kroger, which appears to be going well as they have made reorders.  Though it’s essentially the same taste as their THC beverage, they treat their Beckett’s brand as a separate entity to avoid the red tape associated with the THC line.  They are essentially attacking two growing categories at once with essentially the same drink, which also gives cross-brand awareness &amp; additional revenue.

Beckett’s has recently partnered with [Todd Chrisley](https://www.instagram.com/toddchrisley/), the patriarch of the Chrisley Family with an audience of over 2M instagram followers who has the successful reality television show “Chrisley Knows Best” that also has an audience of 2M.

I don’t really have a lot to say about Becketts, as I don’t know a lot about the non-alcohol industry other than according to data it is a growing industry.  I don’t really care about it that much either, because to me Beckett’s is just a cherry on top - this beverage line is literally just duplicating their THC beverages and taking out the THC and calling it a product.  It seems like a smart move to increase their revenue without reinventing the wheel.  A lot of other Tinley investors seem to think it will be a short term catalyst for the SP as it gets carried in more and more mainstream store locations.

**Co-packing deals:**

Their bottling facility allows for a multitude of different styles of beverages &amp; different concentrations of THC.  From single serve bottles, to mini-shots, to multi-serve bottles, carbonated or not carbonated, and with a variety of different flavors.

They announced late last year that they already have at least 12 co-packing clients, 2 of which they have just press released, with 10 more to come in short order.  This means that investing now is a great time to take advantage of the information disparity before their blockbuster deals get announced.

There’s rumors the CEO has already rejected offers to acquire the company, but the way the company is set up to allow other brands to use them like a turn-key beverage platform is screaming for some whale to come in and buy them out at a premium.  This licensing process takes years, and Tinley is among the first-movers.  For example, Molson &amp; Hexo announced Truss Beverages in 2018, but they only received their license to produce THC beverages at their belleville facility in 2020.

Currently Tinley’s has no debt, and is positioned well in the THC bev space to act on both  Canadian and US markets.

Black Stone Minerals LP (BSM) is a Master Limited Partnership (more on that below) that specializes in buying and holding oil and natural gas assets, with over 20 million acres currently in their possession. Rather than doing the drilling themselves, they lease out the assets to other companies, collecting the lease payments without having to invest capex into the actual drilling equipment.

**So what is an MLP anyways?**

(Hint: it's not /r/mylittlepony)

A Master Limited Partnership (MLP) is a type of corporate structure that has some unique benefits and considerations. First, it is a partnership that is publicly traded, so each stock (technically a ""unit"") gives you a direct ownership interest in the MLP. Second, an MLP pays no corporate tax, meaning its cost of capital is lower compared to a regular corporation. Instead, all tax liabilities and cash flows are passed through directly to unitholders (aka you if you decide to buy). Because of this, there are some interesting tax considerations. The distributions you receive from the MLP are not taxed like regular dividends, despite being called that by your broker. Instead, they are applied directly to your cost basis, meaning the tax is deferred until you sell the MLP units, at which point the distributions are taxed at the regular income tax rate. The capital gains from the price of the stock going up are taxed at the regular capital gains rates.

What does this mean for you as a buyer of BSM? The main thing is that it WILL complicate your tax filing. MLP gains have a special tax form, a K-1, that you will have to take into account when filing your taxes. However, with some quick research, you should be able to deal with this with no problem.

More info: https://www.investopedia.com/investing/benefits-master-limited-partnerships/

So why buy BSM?

**Bull Case:**

* *Oil/natgas demand recovering* - this is the biggest factor working in BSM's favor. Because they only own the assets, rather than actually working them, they don't have to deal with the capital costs of extracting the resources. This means that as oil/natgas prices go up, BSM will go up.
* *Strong financials* - BSM has been doing debt reduction the past year and has good, steady cash flow. Since this is an MLP, this means more money distributed to you. Plus, 30% profit margin ain't nothing to sneeze at.
* *Dividend* - If you're a dividends type of person, BSM pays 6.5% annually (roughly, and it varies with income because it's an MLP). However, even if you don't care, BSM's next dividend (for unitholders of record on 2/16) is up to $0.175 from $0.15 previous quarters. This is bullish.
* *Good analyst ratings* - Yes, analysts aren't super useful most of the time, but I want to point out that BSM is currently below the mean analyst PT, and the newest PT revision to come out bumps that analyst's PT from $12 to $13.
* *Strong trend* - BSM has been on a roar since the beginning of this year, it's been nothing but up, it's already up 42% YTD, and the momentum seems to be holding. Continuing the trend (past performance etc etc, but just as a thought exercise), BSM should hit $12.50 within 1.5-3 months, a 31% increase from today.

**Risks:**

* *Oil/natgas market drops* - The most obvious risk to any energy sector company, lower prices = less revenue
* *More complicated tax structure* - Like I mentioned above, MLPs complicate your taxes. You'll have to spend more time doing them, and do some learning about how MLPs work.
* *Regulations on oil/natgas* - With Democrats now in power in DC, there is a higher potential for climate action or other political news that could impact the O&amp;G sector.

Overall, BSM is a company that seems to have a strong short-term future, with good financials and good potential for price improvement. Due to its strategy of buying assets and leasing them out, it has lower debt and costs compared to other O&amp;G companies. I would consider this a short-term play (long-term I think/hope that fossil fuels are on their way out), with a timeframe of a few months. If you want to buy, do it before 2/16 so you can take advantage of the next dividend distribution. **My price target is $12.50, which was the price pre-COVID.

It hit about $30.77 for the day's high, wanting to get some other people's thoughts on this stock. I did own it, until this afternoon, couldn't resist not selling it at that price. I think it should come back down, really hoping that it does so I can buy back in.

Where do you see this stock going in the long run? I think it should come back as the vaccine gets distributed more, although time is of the essence. If summer travel is not safe, Airlines will lose one of the more profitable times of the year, and most likely we will see bankruptcy become much more of a possibility than it already is. Air Canada's Q4 earnings will be released on February 12th, this will tell us what to expect in the coming months. One thing about Air Canada though is that they provide so many jobs for Canadian citizens and inevitably have a major impact on Canada's economy.

They have multiple contracts with the US government (1) (2), and they also own 26 manufacturing facilities worldwide and have been around for over 100 years. 

Why is this important? Sounds like a boomer stock? Not exactly. The reason I read further into this stock because they were apart a PIPE investor in Microvast (THCB). (3) Microvast is the only company on the globe that specializes in batteries for heavy duty vehicles. Along with the PIPE investment to help them raise cash for their IPO, they also announced a partnership too. Further, Microvast is building a factory in Tennessee that is set to start production in 2022. Guess who also owns a giant factory in TN? $OSK does! you can see it at (4) 

So $OSK invests in a company that can put their battery in any heavy duty vehicle. Why does this matter? Because $OSK has the production capability to electrify their fleet. They are in bed with the US gov, and can be a huge part of the electrification of American vehicles over the next 10 years.

I bought a small position here as I see the play and what OSK is planning to do. It's ""easy"" now to pick a winner in the EV space. Every bodies apparently a market genius now. Did you know that 100s of companies went bankrupt when society was adopting vehicles? Only a few companies won. Now this is of course different as it will be a multi-company effort to electrify all vehicles. It's not a winner takes all situation. However, those with the first mover advantage can occupy a significant amount of the market. I believe that Oshkosh is in a position to do this with heavy duty vehicles, as it appears as though they are the only one with the means to do so.

Also multiple directors bought stock today. You can find those filings on the SEC website. GLTA!

1612466779.0|0.0|t3_lcnqas|41.0|"Mohawk Group is quietly becoming a leading consumer products company that currently sells mostly on the Amazon platform. With 11 brands and over 1000+ product SKU’s, Mohawk is on pace for a record 2021 of projected $370m in annual sales. The company uses data from multiple sources, including Amazon, where most of its sales come from, along with other third party sources. Their strategy is straightforward: find categories where there is no clear leader, improve the product by addressing pain points in negative reviews, and automate marketing and logistics to become the leading seller within the category. The goal is to do this across categories, **internationally and even on other marketplace platforms.** They are already successful with product lists on Shopify and Walmart, in addition to Amazon.

WHAT THEY WANT TO DO: Mohawk’s goal is to find annuity like categories/products that require limited annual refining. For example, a mini fridge between now and a couple of years from now will likely need minimal version changes.

WHAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO: Mohawk wants to stay clear of short term trending categories or products that expose them to product listing displacement. For example, portable headphones like AirPods change every 6 months. That is not what they want.

SO HOW

The answer is AI Mohawk eCommerce Engine, or ""AIMEE"". This internal software solution unifies idea generation, inventory, automated marketing, warehousing, and logistics. Most single sellers use single point solutions for all these essential business functions with little interoperability (Jungle Scout or Helium 10). For example, can you successfully automate marketing and pricing if your marketing engine does not know how much inventory is in stock? It seems unmanageable at scale and therefore single point software solutions limit product expansion. This is why API's were prioritized by companies like Salesforce with their acquisition of MuleSoft to aggregate data.

AIMEE is utilized in 3 ways.

**First is product discovery and creation.** And it works. See it: type ""countertop refrigerator"" or ""dehumidifier"" into Amazon, and you can see Mohawk's hOmeLabs brand on the top labeled as ""bestseller"" with editorial recommendations and thousands of reviews above 4.5 star average. Note - this is **digital real estate moat**. Each product carries its own moat. Digital version of physical real estate.

They have plans of 8-12 product launches each month. They have targets of $1-1.5m in annual sales for products, with a contribution margin target north of 10-15% now. **Approximately 80% of the company’s products became profitable within three months of launch**. The company defines such profitability by a positive “contribution margin” which accounts for all variable costs associated with a product, such as manufacturing and marketing but not fixed costs.

**The second is automation capabilities**, which bring inherent efficiency to the business. MWK has been able to keep its headcount nearly flat while maintaining high revenue growth - as of FY19, they had 144 workers (61 employees and 83 independent contractors). That's $792000 revenue per worker in FY19; and then for FY20, they guide 185 million revenue with only 150 workers ([https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpR8AGRXIAIRBli?format=jpg&amp;name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpR8AGRXIAIRBli?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)), which yields $1.23 million per worker!

**Third, AIMEE allows Mohawk to discover acquisition targets based on category killers.** Management knows they can't compete within all categories, and instead, they can acquire these category leading products at an enterprise accretive 2-4x EBITDA today.

This accretive acquisition success is continually confirmed even as of this week:

&gt;Feb 2, 2021 Alliance Global Partners analyst Brian Kinstlinger raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares following the company's acquisition of Healing Solutions. The ""solid"" acquisition validates Mohawk's strategy, Kinstlinger tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees Mohawk as a ""rare business that can buy companies on the cheap and easily integrate, while creating instant shareholder value given its relatively high valuation (like an arbitrage).""

Other growth potentials: **Platform as a Service, or PaaS.** Mohawk could provide AIMEE as an end to end software solution for product discovery to support functionality, along with an on ramp to multi party warehousing and logistics. We can think about potential users, and potential revenue per user. Single point solutions like Jungle Scout generate \~$300-400 in average revenue per user, while Amazon’s marketplace supports over 3 million sellers worldwide. This space could resemble what Snowflake and other multi-cloud vendors are doing in cloud, creating a platform on top of platforms. If Mohawk were to enter this in the future, expect the stock to be valued like SaaS and its forward price to sales ratio should explode even higher.

**VALUATION**

Management guides conservatively and constantly raises outlook, and analysts will be raising price targets continually:

&gt;Feb 2, 2021 For full year 2021, the Company expects net revenue to be in the range of $340M to $370M, **up from** $290M to $320M, reflecting the addition of the Healing Solutions business. The Company is establishing a net income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in a range of $1M to $5M due primarily to quarterly interest expense, net and stock-based compensation expense. The Company is also establishing an Adjusted EBITDA estimate for the year ended December 31, 2021, which it expects to be in the range of $28M to $32M.  
&gt;  
&gt;Feb 3, 2021 Roth Capital analyst Matt Koranda raised the firm's price target on Mohawk Group to $37 from $16 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst notes that Mohawk has announced the acquisition of Healing Solutions and increased/introduced 2021 revenue/adjusted EBITDA guidance, **which both appear highly conservative.**

Current Mohawk market cap as of writing: $831 million at $31.8 per share

Revenue growth rate: expected to be &gt;50% (FY20 guided to 185M, FY21 current guidance at 370M). They have a revenue CAGR of 79% since 2016 (Mohawk reported revenues of $73.3 million in 2018, up 101% from 2017, with the top-line doubling each year since 2015)

3Q 2020 results showed operating income increased to $0.1 million compared to an operating loss of $(14.1) million in the third quarter of 2019.

Contribution margin improved to 19.1% from 8.0% in the third quarter of 2019.

Current NTM EV/Sales: 1.8x

I firmly believe the stock should be valued **at least** 5x NTM EV/Sales by the end of 2021, if they continue to execute. This is based on management's conservative guidance, continued insane growth rate, increasing margins, massive TAM, future international growth potential, future potential SaaS opportunities. MWK can be viewed as blend of CPG and a software/machine learning company where comps for latter trade at even higher multiples.

I would therefore not be surprised if share prices hit $120 at the end of this year ($3 billion market cap valuation)

**RISKS:**

\-Some consider Amazon Basics as a competing risk, but I wouldn't think so. $295 billion of products were sold on Amazon in 2020. That's expected to grow to $500 billion in the next five years. Amazon cannot be the best in every subcategory on its *massive* marketplace, and Amazon would prefer sellers put their own capital at risk. **Jeff Bezos knows this (see link below), and himself said he wants third party sellers to succeed.** He wants the marketplace to grow which in the long run makes Amazon more money over customer's spending lifetime, than trying to take short term gain by elbowing sellers off the marketplace platform. He knows he can't win every category. As of December 2020, the amount of Amazon Basics products in the top 10 of their categories fell to near February 2018 levels. This figure peaked to nearly 500 in July of 2019 and has trended lower ever since to 346 products.

\-Small cap, which means volatility. Volume is still low, only \~1.3 million shares get traded even on big news days. This means if you are a very emotional investor, you might panic sell - I would expect frequent dips to occur that are unrelated to the fundamentals of the company.

\-Geopolitical risks: any major escalation in a china trade war or black swan event (another pandemic or such) that disrupts supply chains would be a huge negative.

\-To fund more acquisitions they need to raise more capital. I expect share dilution to occur later this year with secondary offerings.

Here is some organic matter to read 

Weed stocks amiright? Anywho, I think CGC is one of the most under rated weed stocks out of the top majority out there. Before the previous weed bubble burst around September-Oct 2018 Canopy Growth was trading at around 48$usd... close to the same price it is trading at currently (44$usd around the time of this post) 

Since this time Canopy Growth (CGC) has acquired numerous businesses. From there pairing with Spectrum Therapeutics in 2019, to their partnership with BioSteel. Lets take a closer look at BioSteel shall we? 

BioSteel is now being packaged with all eco friendly packaging that was recently started in December of 2020. They have multiple sports partnerships with the Brooklyn Nets, Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76'ers and from partnering with people like Erin Andrews, Deandre hopkins &amp; PATRICK MAHOMES II. Biosteel is already set up in multiple states which helps the expansion into the United States much easier for CGC's growth. BioSteel uses all natural products and is sugar free, what also helps is their use of Reyes Beer Division which helps distribution a lot in my books. 

[Link#1  Biosteel](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/biosteel-rapidly-expands-u-s-footprint-with-mega-distributors-for-new-ready-to-drink-beverages-810248091.html)

[Link#2 Biosteel](https://technical420.com/cannabis-article/canopy-growths-acquisition-of-biosteel-is-starting-to-look-insanely-shrewd/)

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to Spectrum Therapeutics, remember them? Spectrum is already set up around the world, which once again helps CGC'S expansion incredibly since that 2018 September 48$ stock price. Spectrum partnered with Canopy in 2019 and is set up in Australia, South America, Africa and Europe.

I’ve been reading this sub and other finance subs for a while now, and it seems like retail investors like us primarily do two types of analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis seems like a subset of statistical arbitrage where you try to find “valuable” companies by looking at their financials and comparing it to other companies in same sector. Technical analysis seems like it’s trying to gauge investor sentiment graphically. However, I’m not sure how relevant these forms of analyses are in the world of quantitative easing, low interest rate, and quantitative hedge funds. With quantitative easing and low interests rates, it seems like the context has changed too much for value investing to be relevant. We always joke that the stock will go down because the company had a blowout earnings report and justify it by saying ""it's priced in"". With bots, quantitative hedge funds can look at fundamentals faster, look at a wider set of companies, better define relevant companies to compare against, and develop more intricate models rather than simply looking at P/E ratios. So, whatever fundamental analysis we do will always be at a disadvantage.

In the aftermath of a certain stock fiasco, I think information arbitrage using memes is a legitimate form of analysis, maybe better than fundamental and technical. For those that don’t know, information arbitrage is when we use alternative data other than a company’s financials to evaluate a company. For example, quantitative hedge funds use AI to read through news articles to gauge sentiment, satellite images to track shipping, web-traffic data to predict which retails will have the best quarter. Although we can’t do these tasks as fast as computers, I think humans have an edge, albeit small and fading, in understanding language and especially memes. Language changes quickly on social media, and humans adapt to the evolution of language much more quickly and with less supervision than AI. Meme formats change and evolve quickly online, and we’re able to understand the underlying meaning with few examples whereas AI need lots of heavily curated data to learn the same thing. By the time they learn one meme, the format may change invalidating the older model. It’s true that we have our own problems when we get sucked into echo chambers and personal feelings, but I think we have a smallish window before AI catches up to analyzing public sentiment through memes, and we shouldn’t discount the “meme analysis” as a legitimate form of financial analysis for now.

Do you think it’s still relevant for us retail investors to do fundamental analysis and technical analysis? What are your thoughts on meme-ing as a form of financial analysis?"|investing|The validity of memeing as a form of financial analysis|21.0|0.82

Here’s some actual DD on GameStop: These are the point I personally used to make the decision not to go all in on GameStop. (The price is currently sitting at 2x what it was when I made this list, but I stand by my decision.)

You think they’re going to pivot into being some massive online retailer? They’re not.

**Remember ThinkGeek?** It used to be an amazing place to buy cool, niche nerd stuff. They designed and sold their own products, along side some licensed products. I still have a bunch of awesome stuff I purchased in its heyday. It was the place to go for anything not mainstream.

Gamestop purchased ThinkGeek in 2015. The first thing they did was sell out to Disney. The store became a crap-fest of Star Wars and Minecraft merch.

After purchasing ThinkGeek, GameStop opened some ThinkGeek-branded retail stores. Again, the company you think is going to pivot to online turned a successful website into a failing junk shop in the mall.

ThinkGeek shut down in 2019. The only remnant of ThinkGeek are those racks in GameStop stuffed with shitty Minecraft plushes and water bottles.

Two takeaways: -GameStop isn’t able to competently assess what consumers want. -GameStop doesn’t know how to have an online presence. -GameStop can't even keep a profitable business running even if it's handed to them.

**GameStop Revenue:**

40% of GameStop’s revenue comes from screwing over children on used game buybacks. If GameStop decided to move away from Video Games, they lose a huge revenue stream.

\-The GameStop business model is not agile enough to change significantly.

**Computer Parts:**

GameStop employees are incompetent. In 2018, I purchased a White Wii U from a GameStop. The clerk told me he didn’t know the Wii U came in white.

Selling PC parts would require more space. At the average GameStop’s current size, they would struggle to have a significant inventory of computer parts. Becoming something like MicroCenter would require GameStop to invest in real estate to get enough room to grow.

\-If GameStop sells computer parts, they will have only a handful of items in store and the clerks will not be knowledgeable enough to help people decide which part to buy.

Originally, there's a few main takeaways:

1. New CEO is phenominal.  Car industry his whole life.  He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises.  This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now.  They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing.  I expect strong 2021 outlook.

2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue.  Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands.  For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa. 

3.  The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150.  They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands.  This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.

4.  They have 2 other extremely promising aspects.  First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans.  Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area.  The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal.  Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.  

5.  The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason.  Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good.  Most have looked into it, some have bought it.  They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them.  They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.

6.  Rivian.  The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars.  Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion.  They made several billion on that investment alone.

7.  One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control.  They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons.  As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical.  People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar.  This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

Other side notes: Bronco will be massive and already doing well.  Yes, theyre less concerned with revenue so its dropping, but still, doubling profits but less revenue is fine.

Market took down $700Mn issuance yesterday and the stock still traded up on the day. Issuance shows that the model is catching on in markets.

Mar 19 - 27 calls

Plan to role my febs into march on dips.

**What is OpenDoor?**

OpenDoor is a principal dealer in the real estate market. Instead of hiring a real estate agent to sell your house charging 3-5% commission and having to deal with the showings and negotiations, Opendoor will buy the house right off the seller for cold hard cash. Not only that, the Company will provide ancillary services to clients including refis, and possibly home credit lines in the future.

Ultimately, as the primary point of contact for a buyer and seller, OpenDoor not only disrupts the embedded real estate industry cabal, but also the banking cabal. By providing financing/brokerage and other ancillary services we believe that the $1.6Trn TAM presented by the Company is low.

**Why Now?**

Yesterday, OpenDoor announced a 24Mn share raise equating to approximately $700Mn. The market took it down no problem and the stock traded up on the day which is strange because raises usually result in price declines due to dilution of existing shareholders. The underlying strength in the stock gives us confidence that we trade much higher over the coming weeks.

On the press release of the raise, OpenDoor said the issuance will be used for ""increasing existing market penetration and to expand into new markets, and for working capital and general corporate purposes."" They have essentially told us that they ran out of cash buying so many homes and needed an additional raise to further expand the business. Given that one of the main bear views has been that most sellers would rather go to the market to attempt to get a better sale value, the raise shows the market that this point of friction is actually not as significant as many believed, likely the reason why the stock traded higher.

**Key Drivers**

With the new leverageable cash (we estimate total $2Bn of levered cash) we expect OpenDoor to announce entry into new markets including Detroit, San Diego, Chicago, San Francisco/San Jose, Seattle, New Orleans, Albuquerque, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami in the near future. We believe that movement into these markets alone would double the revenue opportunity.

U.S. home prices are rising quickly. According to the CoreLogic Home Price Index, December showed home prices spiking 9.2% annually, which was the fastest annual increase since 2014. Month-over-month, prices were up by 1%. Given that OPEN makes most of its money on the s/t gains in housing prices, this data suggests that OPEN will likely blow out sell-side expectations over the next two quarters.

**Prices and sales rising quickly**

Also, home sales are increasing rapidly. COVID is pushing city dwellers to move from major metro areas to the suburbs and other smaller cities where OpenDoor has inventory. Easy monetary policy is further supporting homebuying which will likely drive revenue for the foreseeable future.

**Setup**

OPEN has been battling with the $28-29 resistance for four months, with rising support. If we break to the upside with volume, we could see a move similar to September (\~65%) and October (\~70%).

Yesterday, there was a lot of call buying and a spike in implied vols potentially foreshadowing a big move in the future.

In sum, OPEN is a great business and the stock has a great setup. We expect the stock to be higher over the coming months.

My thoughts:
**Apple (APPL)** brings the premium brand name, **Hyundai-Kia (GDR)** brings the automotive industry experience, distribution, and maybe some marketing, **Canoo (GOEV)** brings their B2B skateboard EV platform/ hardware, and **Blackberry (BB)** will play a significant role in the software/ tech security with their QNX system. 

In my opinion this collaboration of companies will bring us: **THE  A P P L E  C A R**

&gt;Our investigation into Clover Health has spanned almost 4 months and has included more than a dozen interviews with former employees, competitors, and industry experts, dozens of calls to doctor’s offices, and a review of thousands of pages of government reports, insurance filings, regulatory filings, and company marketing materials.

&gt;Critically, Clover has not disclosed that its business model and its software offering, called the Clover Assistant, are under active investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is investigating at least 12 issues ranging from kickbacks to marketing practices to undisclosed third-party deals, according to a Civil Investigative Demand (similar to a subpoena) we obtained.

1) Using banks (or taking credit cards).

2) Listing on major exchanges

3) Moving product across state lines

4) Taking any tax breaks

The Canadian companies are running right now based on name recognition and the US based MSOs are lagging despite them having stronger financials and already being in the US which means less regulatory hurdles when federal prohibition ends. Not only are the financials currently more attractive but the end of the above regulatory issues will all lead to gains in efficiency. I also believe Canadian is outperforming MSOs due to robinhood not allowing OTC trading. If you want to get in on Robinhood buy the ETF $MSOS.

Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&amp;P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&amp;P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability &amp; Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&amp;P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&amp;P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&amp;t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH &amp; TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&amp;P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&amp;ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

Alpine  4 Technologies ($ALPP) is a holding company, with multiple  subsidiaries, and you've probably seen it in this sub multiple times,  and with good reason. I'll try to use bullet points for you to follow  along much easier.

* Backed by the founders of $TSLA
* Low share structure
* 2 Drone Subsidiaries
* Contracts with the goddamn US Air Force
* Apple is a customer
* Acquiring 3-4 new subsidiaries this year alone
* Just made $1M in 1 month from ONE of their many subsidiaries supplying their Silicon Valley EV customers
* Will unload a whopping $170M into the Drone and EV sectors (the obviously hottest sectors of 2021)
* Projecting over $100M+ revenue for 2021, excluding their $170M war chest from before.
* NASDAQ uplist this month (organically, no r/S!)
* American  manufacturing + no Chinese competition due to an executive order signed  by Trump last year  (ALPP has 9 US operating subsidiaries)

**Comparing it to UAVS**

UAVS current SP \~ $11,5  
ALPP current SP \~ $3.6  
UAVS  is mostly a drone company, that reported  $1.2 million of revenue. UAVS  hit $15 pps  with only $2M of revenue. ALPP generated $26.6 millions!

In  January 2021QCA, only ONE of ALPP's subsidiaries (1 out of 8) reported a  revenue of +$1 million. Like I said previously, they will unleash a War  Chest of $170M, and UAV'swar chest is only $25M. ALPP is severely  undervalued, especially compared to UAVS.

**Conclusion**

Last week, stockinvest ( I think, could be another), predicted this stock to reach 15-23$ in 3 MONTHS!

The standard for Quality Assurance for Additive Manufacturing

-So first of all, what is additive manufacturing?
Additive manufacturing is the production of three dimensional precision metal parts.

-Why is it important?
Additive manufacturing is the future of technological building materials using 3-D printers.

Companies who currently use 3-D printers fail to have reliability and quality.
The solution is Sigma Labs ($SGLB)

Sigma Labs offers proprietary technology which takes the human error out of quality assurance. With their IPQA technology they can monitor the manufacturing process in real-time, while quickly and efficiently makes changes to protect the integrity of the product.

Sigma’s proprietary software addresses the inherent challenges of in-process quality assurance:

-Eliminating the traditional trial and error approach to quality assurance for additive manufacturing.
-Manufacturers don’t just look for defects or discover them after it’s too late. They help build quality into the part. Quality cannot be inspected into the part.
-Reducing the cost associated with today’s “make-and-break” approach to certifying AM part quality by seeing and analyzing the structure of a 3D-printed part while it is being made.

SGLB is significantly undervalued for the growth potential it has.
They have 4 major contracts at the moment with Mitsubishi, DMG MORI, Additive Insustries, and Materialise
They currently hold 11 patents and 33 are more are pending. They are currently cash positive after $4.5 mil public offering. Insider buying is up in recent months. Ceo has bought 20,000 shares recently as well as other executives.  
My conservative price target is $5 short term.
Long term with contracts in place $15-$20+

PROS:

-Lowest cost producer of natural gas with the largest reserves in the world.

-Immense infrastructure in pipelines and facilities, hundreds of billions of $ have been invested into it. Europe, China, all bases covered.

-If the anti-nuclear sentiment holds, nat gas is the only viable option left after coal is phased out. It's prudent to hedge this assumption by holding some uranium miners as well.

-Balance sheet is strong.

-Valuation is a joke. P/E is often around 3, P/B .2 or something.

-Good dividend policy, 50% of profits will be paid out in dividends. Will probably yield around 10-15% going forward.

-Is doing research into producing green hydrogen from natural gas.


CONS:

-Russia; geopolitics, sanctions, owned &gt;50% by the government

-Nord Stream 2 might still take a few years to finish. A minor nuisance.

-If a green revolution of a magnificent scale really happens. I'm talking about a solution to the baseline power problem of rebewables.


I've been long this stock for years. While my cost basis is around the current stock price, I've been reaping large divvies and have no problem waiting for the valuation to correct, while collecting a juicy dividend in the meantime. Don't care if it takes years or decades.

To give some context,

I bought stocks in VALARIS:VAL a long while ago and this company has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy months ago, bringing down my holdings to -95%. It seems that their new ticker is VALPQ, but what I want to know is if my holdings of VAL have been re-issued into VALPQ automatically or if I am stuck on their closing price on the previous ticker? Would they have sent out an email to shareholders about what they want to do with their holdings and what is the usual default if the shareholders don't respond (I can't find any emails from them).

My broker has sent me a holdings summary and on that sheet the listed ticker/description is "" VAL.N - VALARIS CL A ORD "" and there is a discrepancy between the brokers current value (0.33USD) and VALPQ 's value @ 0.11USD. So I've gotten confused.

I want to know this info because if there is a extreme slight chance they could recover out of chp 11 then I want to hold on to the stock cause it's already down so much and I don't need the money tied to it. But if I am stuck with the old shares, and won't automatically be holding the new shares IF they recover then there is no point in holding the investment in there.

((This and GTX are the only two shares in my portfolio in the red, and badly in the red and both of them share a similar issue (GTX @ 2.01USD ticker to GTXMQ @ 6.48USD; but also discrepancy from broker - GTX facing class action). My other holdings have made up for these losses more than enough, but I need to make an informed decision whether or not to hold them or if they won't move ever anyway.))

While everyone is with their focus on GME and all surrounding it, some other interesting things still happening.

Velodyne Lidar is, you gussed, a company specialized in LiDAR technology. What's that? Well, for those who spent the lockdown playing iRacing or other fancy racing simulator you should have heard that they use LiDAR to model the tracks. LiDAR has plenty of uses and one hot topic recently is their application in autonomous vehicles. You can check a bit about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar?wprov=sfla1)

So, it happens that Apple doesn't know what to do with the piles of cash they're sitting in and they are thinking to throw a few billions in making an EV car. The problem is they really don't know how to make one so to solve this small problem they're in talks with Hyundai/Kia group and they close to reach to an agreement now: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-may-build-a-fully-autonomous-electric-car-with-hyundai-kia-report-11612394804?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-may-build-a-fully-autonomous-electric-car-with-hyundai-kia-report-11612394804?siteid=yhoof2&amp;yptr=yahoo)

It happens that Velodyne already has a partnership with Hyundai and they actually use it. Hyundai also invested 50M in this company ""to mass-produce lidar system in 2021 for level 3 autonomous driving"" [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191022006225/en/Hyundai-Mobis-Invests-in-and-Forms-Partnership-with-Velodyne-Lidar](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191022006225/en/Hyundai-Mobis-Invests-in-and-Forms-Partnership-with-Velodyne-Lidar)

You've also should have heard about LiDAR with Luminar. While LAZR has a much cooler ticker, VLDR is already profitable and have a nice list of costumers. Even without the Apple Car they can survive and have a bright future.

Anyway, the recent news about the Apple/Hyundai partnership may be the trigger for some crazy run in VLDR but in my opinion this should be seen mostly as a long play.

I was listening to this podcast with Chamath and his friends talking about what happened with Gamestop and I thought it brought up two key ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

The value of the stock is not based on the value of the company but what someone is willing to pay for it in the future. I know Mark Cuban also mentioned this in his call with CNBC that companies haven't paid dividends for years and that proves that the valuation of a stock is detached from the fundamentals. What does this say about fundamental investing? Does more emphasis need to be placed on the vision of a company as a measure of valuation?

&amp;#x200B;

They also mentioned that decentralization is needed in a system, they focused more on social media but I believe it applies to financial markets too. Brokers, clearing houses, DTCC are all limited entryways to the financial markets and when it gets too crowded, there is failure like we saw this week. Will there be changes made to our financial system? Personally this has also made me understand the value thesis of cryptocurrency better. Before, I thought it was worthless because it was connected to no underlying asset but maybe decentralization is an important enough asset?

&amp;#x200B;

As some of you already know Tilray and Aphria are going to merge in Q2, with Tilray becoming the surviving Company.

Now the fun thing about it:

Aphria stockholders are to obtain 0.8381 of one share of Tilray for each Aphria share they own.

Aphria Stock: [finance.yahoo.com/quote/APHA?p=APHA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://de.finance.yahoo.com/quote/APHA?p=APHA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

Tilray Stock: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY?p=TLRY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLRY?p=TLRY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)

They move pretty similarly, almost identically.

\-

With the price in mind lets do math:   **16.60$** /  **26.31$** = **0,631** (**63**%)

so Aphira is only **63**% compared to every Tilray Stock

now considering we are getting **0,8381** for each Aphria Stock:  **26.31$ \* 0,8381** = **22,050$**

Feel free to prove me wrong,but for me it looks to me like you'll get around 6$ - after the merger -for free just for owning Aphria stock."|investing|Tilray Inc. and Aphria Inc observation + mathematics|81.0|0.93

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

So.. I mentioned possibly doing a 'post mortem' on my GME trade, and apparently that was in high demand.  That being said, I'll call it an 'evolution' instead, as we still don't yet know what will happen next.

Rather than going through a full narrative, I made a [crazy annotated chart](https://u.teknik.io/xg2HJ.PNG) to chronicle some of the key points in my trade decisions.

Strangely enough, I think it might better convey how the week went from my perspective a little better than a full narrative.  If you catch any inconsistencies between the chart, or my writing below, please point it out.  It's very easy to ex post facto ascribe to yourself the benefit of 20/20 foresight and overlook mistakes you made at the time.

I'll walk through my thought process for newer traders.  Keep in mind I'm trading my hobby account, not a self-directed IRA, so the stakes are a lot lower and tolerance for risk is much higher:

1. I would probably trace the initial origins of this trade for me back to November.  I wasn't a genius like DFV finding GME at that point, but once the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine efficacy data came out, I decided to go rummaging through XRT (retail)  and other unloved sectors for value that should rebound on the sector rotation to the 'reopening trade' given the nosebleed multiples in QQQ (the NASDAQ/big tech companies that dominated the market in 2020).  Figured I'd mostly ride the SMH (semiconductor index) and a few other favorites while digging around.  Looking at unloved sectors is the value/long term investor version of 'buy the dip' (typically the dip might last years, but I figured in this case the evolution would be much faster because it would be driven by progress against COVID).
2. ID'd GME for the short list because of an unusually regular pattern on the daily chart RSI.  In hindsight I would probably attribute that to one of the hedge funds trying to stealthily unwind its short position veeeeery slowly, but GME being a dead corner of the market, it shows up in the data like a lighthouse beacon, in a channel upward just bouncing off RSI 70.  Someone is gradually accumulating a big long position or covering a big short position.  TJX's looks better, but valuation too high already (over-loved).
3. Deep dive DD, including DD from WSB just makes me think this is exactly what I've been looking for.  Better buy in before it escapes completely.  
4. Ok..it made some massive moves already, but with the bonus of the short interest anomaly this is too good..  and it comes with awesome memes--can't say no to the package deal. $38 (my first buy) is pretty good, but I'll write April $40 cash-secured puts to net me a better entry (or additional profit if they go unexercised).  This is a common technique investors can use to get either a better entry than they otherwise could get, or some participation in the upside if the price runs away--I find it easier to do this than setting an aggressively low GTC limit buy and keeping my fingers crossed.
5. Digging deeper into the short squeeze thesis tells me it's practically mathematically guaranteed to go off any moment.  I take off some cash-secured puts, liquidate a lot of the rest of my portfolio, etc. because if things get as crazy as I think they might, it's better to have almost nothing else in your portfolio to complicate matters.  This is especially true as margin requirements start rising.
6. Volatility starts going crazy.  You almost can't see it on the daily chart with the scaling of the 500+ peak, but if you focus on the 1/21 to 1/26 timeframe there were a few brutal Eiffel tower moves (parabolic up then down).  All kinds of misinformation about what is going on starts flying.  People start FOMOing into those moves only to despair out on the other side for a loss.  Few if any seem to be willing to talk about the situation in a way that newer traders can understand.  I start posting a bit here and there, just getting a feel for reddit.
7. On 1/25 I see a few heated discussions regarding whether the gap up over the weekend, then crash down that day in fact WAS the squeeze, and I try to jump in and correct the record a bit.. people are panicking out on the downside of that move because they're being told the squeeze is over.  That motivates me to write my first article in the series.  Don't finish it that evening, decide to finish it in the morning.  It drops on this sub essentially as what we now know was the squeeze is achieving liftoff.
8. Looking at my posts from 1/25 to 1/29, I'm probably too tuned in to the hype, but tuning in to sentiment is important in sentiment-driven momentum trading.  I do try to consistently try to warn new traders from FOMOing in, but that doesn't stop me from trying to help them understand what is going on.
9. One thing I've learned the hard way--don't carry a sentiment-driven momentum trading position through a weekend.  That usually does not end well.
10. The weekend gives me time to step back and resume a more analytical approach and you may notice my writing style reflects that at that point.  Looking back, I notice a lot of sloppiness and some outright errors in my realtime read of the situation.  I try to point some of those out if I feel they might be material to others' trading decisions.
11. At this point I'm thinking the squeeze has been mostly squoze (but for a few 'technically it's still possible' type scenarios).  I figure since so many of the regular readers/commentators on my posts are going to ride it, I'll keep a position on to ride it with them too.  We'll see where we go from here!

I actually did really well on the trade overall.  Could have done much better had I just stuck to my trades rather than reading and writing on Reddit, but the numerous comments I've seen where I or other commentators in this sub were able to provide good, level-headed feedback and advice helped people make better decisions make it worthwhile to me.  I guess it just bothered me too much to see the vacuum of real information and willingness of people to push their trade on others.  I didn't see that kind of behavior in WSB even just the week prior when I first joined.

Also, while it turned out very well, I have to be completely intellectually honest and admit that I could have lost it all too.  This was a crazy volatile trade with more twists and turns and unexpected developments than I could have imagined, and that's even given that I actually believe it when I say that I don't know what will happen next.  This is something anyone knowingly walking into this type of situation should realize and plan for.

Each person has a different tolerance for risk, though I will say that while I was and am willing to take significant risks with my hobby trading account, I try to never take entirely irrational risks.  I also actively put at risk a relatively small percent of even my hobby trading capital (\~20%).  It may not seem like it, as you've seen my writing on a high volatility play, but my overall capital disposition is very conservative and low-risk/low-volatility in aggregate.  It's because I know that most of it is safe that I can feel comfortable and controlled making very high risk plays.

I've seen people put it all on the line and totally clutch trade big momentum--I wish I could, but I know that's not me.

There are a few sayings that traders have as almost jokes, but with an undercurrent of dark humor in many cases:

1. **Rule #1: never lose money.** From Warren Buffett, value investing legend.  I'm a little more flexible with this for myself, and amend it to ""always have a plan that guarantees you can never lose more money than you intended to put at risk.""  If you are in the red on this trade, realized or unrealized, don't feel bad--I'm very confident that most people are in the same boat.  Try to think of it as tuition for one of the most intense, and hopefully intellectually productive seminars ever, held only once every decade or so.
2. **No one ever went bankrupt taking profit, or pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.** (counterpoint: tons of people have gone essentially bankrupt riding profits right back into the ground--particularly in climactic late bubble market action, like the dotcom bubble).  To those of you feeling bad that you could have made more, be glad that you were in the green.  It's something to celebrate.  You traded a black swan event and came out ahead.
3. **Buy low, sell high.**  MUCH harder to do consistently than it seems.  Particularly if you initiate a [trade from FOMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/gkyxdqv/?context=3).  For those of you who did this, try to remember what that was like, and think of ways you can manage those emotions in the future, or ensure you never put yourself in a similar position if you'd rather not have to.  Either approach will be healthier for both you and your wallet in the long run.

Alright, this post is long enough as is.  We'll see where the rocket takes us tomorrow.

As I started making better trades, my account went from about -2k to currently about 3k of realized gains and 15k of unrealized gains. (up over 100%)

It feels like just about every day I'll see another $1,000 gain on my account and it really emotionally overwhelms me. I'm young and too some of you this may not be a lot, but to me this is the most money I've ever had and I've just made as much money in the last 6 months as I have probably since I started working. 

I feel a constant rush when things go well and I sometimes feel the urge to splurge on eating out or buying myself gifts, but that's something I usually never do. I'm the kind of guy who usually saves everything, but this money makes me want to spend it. 

It feels too good to be true but here I am. I have the feeling in my gut that this can't last forever but my analysis is that things will still be bullish for my portfolio. 

That said I do have a bit of margin debt (4.5k on a 30k account) and some call options that are in the money. I've also never really had to worry about capital gains tax yet. 

Is this a feeling that you get used to with experience? Is it okay to have some degree of lifestyle inflation? 
Do you have any general advice or wisdom?

**MASSIVE AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY DEMAND.**

Everything requires semi-conductors now. The huge technology boom has led to an unprecedented increase in demand for semi-conductors:

\- Smart devices, cars now require massive processing power to compute automated “smart/enhanced” driving features. 

\- Car media technology is no longer just analog, everything is Digital.

\- Consumer devices are “smarter” than ever. Speakers, headphones.

\- “Connected” devices running on networks are growing more complex, 5G is a good example. 

Even without covid **supply cannot keep up**. All the major electronics companies are in a race to build new factories and update to the latest equipment.

Teradyne Provides the **AUTOMATION** equipment for almost all of them. 

* 50% Of semi conductor tests are $TER
* Biggest customers 
   * Intel
      * 7 Billion new factory 2020
   * TSM
      * 12 Billion new factory 2020
   * Samsung
      * 25 Billion new factory 2020
* The biggest issue with semi-conductors has always been a shortage of supply due to whatever reason.
* New Technology Paradigms that could force rapid production development.
   * Automotive technology explosion
   * 5G technology explosion
   * Space technology Growth
* Shortage of supply for existing products
* By the numbers:
   * Industrial automaton sales declined in 2020 due to covid
   * 43% Growth in System Test segment
   * 10% Growth in 5G segment. Expected to ramp up in 2021.
* Large increase in capital expenditure to keep pace with growth of client demands. (37%)
* Relatively high EPS and revenue expectations
   * Justified by the gigantic demand in semiconductor in the coming decade.
   * Demand is not issue, massive amounts of expenditure needed to keep up with pace of industry. 
* 67% Growth in operating income
* 33% Growth in gross profit
* 64% Increase in EPS
* 31% Increase in cash equivalents, 10% increase in liabilities
* 50% Cash flow growth

**Reflection on Sony**

&gt;!Long term outlook still remains positive. Playstation 5 console sales will plateau, but licensure and sale off first party titles will increase as more titles are released. I believe PS5 will be the most profitable console generation yet from SNE. !&lt;

&gt;!EV technology looks very promising, I suspect one of the Japanese car makers will swoop the technology up or a partnership deal will be announced in the future.!&lt;

&gt;!SNE looks very competitive in the supplier niche for automotive, few other automotive suppliers come close in terms of cutting edge tech.!&lt;

&gt;!Electronics division regaining consistent growth is a good sign.!&lt;

&gt;!Pictures looks like it will be the next possible growth sector of the company with the purchase of crunchyroll, SNE might make a monopoly play in the anime streaming world, carving out a hefty niche.!&lt;

&gt;!I maintain overall that Sony is undervalued for the size and scope of the industry it is in. Very positive outlook on the near term and long term future. !&lt;

**tl;dr** 

$TER is a good long term hold, semiconductors may be cyclical but I believe we're entering the growth territory where demand vastly exceeds supply. The amount of new tech needs lots of chipsets to fuel it's consumption and TER is happy to help manufacturers produce them. At 120$ price after earnings I will be purchasing a long position.

1612418406.0|0.0|t3_lc92fa|0.0|"This is very simple, for all the hype it’s easy to explain exactly what happened and what’s happening. Nikola, a company who has never produced a product and is widely believed to be outright fraud has a marker cap of ~$8.3B as of Feb 3rd, 2021. GameStop, a company with ~40k employees in the growing industry of video games has a market cap of ~$6B. A few months ago a dynamic businessman, Ryan Cohen bought millions of shares of GameStop, and then joined the board with other former Chewy executives (an online pet supply store worth ~$40B). People who had long believed GameStop has more value than the market was giving it (a low of ~$250M total market value at one point), along with new people who now saw potential in this businesses turn around, bought stock in the business. That should be the end of the story.

It’s because hedge funds on Wall Street have again been so greedy that they risked the entire United States financial system. See, these hedge funds “shorted” the stock, 140%. How can you have 140% of an entire companies stock? You can’t but they did. And the risk, which they never considered in their infinite wisdom, is infinite losses. Infinite losses? Yes, a stock price can go to $0 and the shareholders lose all their money and the company is bankrupt. But a stock has no top dollar amount, and when you’re short a stock, you bet it goes to 0, but if you’re wrong it can go as far up as any stock has ever gone for any reason. A good reason would be, the stock went up for fundamental reasons but the short positions couldn’t unwind because you can’t undo 140%, you could only undo 100%. Therefore, in using market manipulation to drive a company into bankruptcy they were suddenly faced with infinite losses, something that would send catastrophic ripples through the financial industry.

So, Robinhood. We all thought they were cool but like Facebook they’re fucking evil because they’re free, so instead of paying $6 a trade we pay $0, which was cool until last week when we found out that in spite of their name Robinhood, they are actually in the business of selling financial data to hedge funds. They take your trade order, and let the hedge funds know so their High Frequency Trading can arbitrage pennies on every trade by “beating” it to the order, millions of times a day. Ok, fuck us millennials, ok yeah but also, a little consumer protection, maybe? Ok - this is where it gets fucked.

What we learned Thursday is that Wall Street and the stock brokers do not have America’s interest their interest is to hedge funds and banks. Trading was restricted, whether it was Robinhood, the brokers, the Market Makers, we may never know but it’s not that important because it reveals that the system is fundamentally and structurally aligned to protect the few existing billionaires against Americans interest. This is a fatal sin against our democratic capitalism and risks everything we stand to be.

Moreover, they did it for a reason, the same people that control our stock markets, the barons of our nations wealth, also risked destroying them with infinite losses. How do you cover -140% to infinity? This would alter the value of every equity in America, so they shut it down.

Now, as we try to piece this together, one wrong is repairing the damage done to individual investors but the bigger change needs to be structural, prosecuting the criminals we allow to run our economy and rebuilding an equitable market to allow the American dream to prosper."|investing|GME a simple understanding|0.0|0.26

Well good news came out about more experienced knowledgable executives getting a spot to lead GME. This is what GME needed last week to trigger the squeeze. 

Why I think this is wildly bullish is simply the fact that it was being bought! 90 dollar price range was low enough for people to buy! I was expecting a vicious decline in price. In terms of the current fundamentals a price around 15-20 is a fair price. I figured it would tank straight down. People are truly holding the line. Volume has been relatively low. If everyone was running for the door then volume would be through the roof. It is not. 

But this is why I think the hedge funds are digging themselves deeper and deeper. I think they were not lying when they said they covered their shorts. I just think that wasn't the whole story. The hedge funds had strong control over price after Robinhood and others restricted trading. I think they rolled over their shorts at a price target of 5-10 bucks into shorts with a price target around 400-500 bucks. They needed a way to make money off this. They are not Warren Buffet or other great investors who will admit their mistakes. They are hedge funds where only the numbers matter and its about being in the club. So the reason why the SI may not have been lowered by much is because they just rolled over their shorts. 

Now the kicker of all this is that they need the price to be much lower to cover their short positions. If they started to cover their shorts the price is going to skyrocket. They need it to go from 5 to 50 during the squeeze not 90 to 900. Because lets not forget, Institutions own over 100% of the shares. Boom there goes all the shares. Every share held not in a institution is essentially a synthetic share. Which is every share retail owns.

$CYTH is a low-float (1M shares tradeable) pharmaceutical company with a $34M market cap. They are on a fast track designation for Phase III drug for NPC (Niemann-Pick Disease Type C) which is a $550M market cap.

And they are planning on applying to the FDA to get a green light for Phase II Alzhiemer trials ($200M market cap).

Their investor presentation goes into details ( [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\_5962373eb7a3261f004d798cebf4c8a3/cyclotherapeutics/db/5/30/pdf/Investor+Presentation+210203.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_5962373eb7a3261f004d798cebf4c8a3/cyclotherapeutics/db/5/30/pdf/Investor+Presentation+210203.pdf) )

$CYTH is presenting Feb 8-10 at the World Symposium Conference.

Their next closest competitor, $SAVA has a market cap of $3 Billion.

$24M vs $3B.... It would take $CYTH share price to hit $1k to match $SAVA market cap. I don't expect that to happen but the sky is the limit on this low-floater.

TLDR:

$CYTH - $8.25 share as of 2/3. $34M market cap. 1M shares tradeable. On track for FDA designations. Similar to $SAVA  who has a $3B Market cap. Potential explosive low-float play.

&amp;nbsp;

First we need to know how much fuel GME bulls have. 

&amp;nbsp;

In order to try and estimate this value, I did some rough calculations. I took the number of sub members (currently 8.4 million) and assumed that 35% of all members were willing to invest. I also assumed that for each member there are another four non-members who are making the same play. I also assumed that each member and their counterparts are willing to invest $10,000. By multiplying these all together, I come out to about $148 billion in buying power. 

&amp;nbsp;

Number of Members - 8,464,258

Percentage Buying GME - 35

Multiplier - 5

Average Investment - $10,000

Total Buying Power - $148,124,515,000

&amp;nbsp;

Now I needed to know how much had been spent leading up to this point. In order to do this, I am going to take the volume traded each day and multiply it by a rough daily average price [(high + low)/2]. The further back I start counting, the more buying power is used up, so to be conservative with my estimate, I will start at open 1/13/2021. This will prevent the big players positions opened before 1/13 from reducing the buying power remaining.

&amp;nbsp;

If I add all of the money spent up, it comes out to a total of about $154 billion. That means the bulls are $6 billion in debt, that can't be right...

That's where covering shorts comes in.

&amp;nbsp;

Not everyone buying from 1/13 - 2/3 was on the bull side. Based on the S3 Partners Short Interest graph below, the shorts covered a lot of positions. These covers need to be factored in to see how much run is really left.

&amp;nbsp;

https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1357075843386904582/photo/1

&amp;nbsp;

Since this chart doesn’t have date points, I will be eyeballing some points so there is a level of error here based on that. Going into 1/13/2021, there were about 69 million shares shorted. Going into 1/28 there were about 62 million shares shorted. There are currently (end of day 2/3) 26.39 million shares shorted. I can estimate the cost to cover those shares by averaging the stock price at the time and multiplying it by the number of shares covered. Although there are minor changes, I am going to say that the number of shorts from 1/15 - 1/28 were constant. 

&amp;nbsp;

Shares Covered 1/13-1/15: 7,000,000

Shares Covered 1/15-2/3: 35,610,000

Total Covered Shares: 42,610,000

&amp;nbsp;

Cost to Cover 1/13-1/15: $244,475,000

Cost to Cover 1/15-2/3: $10,642,820,050

Total Cost to Cover: $10,887,295,050

&amp;nbsp;

This means that of the $154 billion spent over the period of time, about $11 billion was spent by shorts covering their positions. This means that only $143 billion was spent by the bull side out of their $148 billion buying power. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, this is not a perfect estimate of the buying power used because it does not factor in people who buy, sell, and then buy back in with the money they gained from selling. That being said, the goal here is to better understand what is happening and hopefully predict what will happen in the future. I have tried to be conservative in my estimates, but there is always the possibility that my assumptions are way off. 

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward:

Now that the price has come down, the amount of money being spent each day to buy-buy-buy has reduced. The amount spent today was just over $4 billion and that could likely be the cost that holders pay every day to buy up the shares of  traders who decide they want to exit their positions. If my calculations are accurate, there is not much buying power left to make those plays and the price of the stock should slowly start to come down. It could be a few days or a few weeks depending on the accuracy of the assumptions that I have made.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR:

While holding is free, buying the shares of people exiting their positions is not. Based on some assumptions regarding the buying power of the bull side of GME, I estimate that funds are running low and the stock will start to fall in the near future.

&amp;nbsp;

Again, I am not a finance guru, just an engineer so if I have made assumptions that are way off or if there is something that I have overlooked please feel free to let me know.

How can the stock market (shares or market cap) keep going higher and higher if there’s only x amount of dollars in the economy (obv not rn since the fed is printing but like when they stop/ before the fed). Like we see more and more 1 trillion dollar companies , and in the future they might go to 10 trillion or even more in 30 years. How can they reach such a level if there isn’t enough money to cause it to go up like that. Like having 20 companies each worth 10 trillion is a lot of money that needs to be in the economy. 
Or is it the wealth is just being transferred to those companies and everyone else is becoming poorer? Like is there no cap on how high things can go. Can Amazon be worth 20k a share and google worth 50k a a share? Isn’t that too much lol wouldn’t there be a cutoff or that much more money needs to be in the economy to make sense.

On top of that, they basically have the only functional mid band 5g network right now, because the rest of the available spectrum was just recently auctioned off, so at&amp;t and Verizon still need to build their networks. Once more phone makers release mid range 5g phones, 5g demand is likely to increase alot, creating a huge opportunity for T-mobile to grow its user base. 

Price/brand:

T-mobile also has brand recognition (think UnCarrier), and has taken on the image of a low price brand that is disrupting the industry with great deals. People love it when brands offer them value, even if the value is exaggerated by the brand. This is another plus for t mobile

Downsides:
Debt. T mobile took on alot of debt, especially during the bidding wars for 5g bandwidth. If something happens that hurts T-mobiles revenue, they could be at risk. Also, while t mobile acquired alot of midband spectrum, at&amp;t got the most low band, which is better for rural areas since it has a long reach. So at&amp;t might be able to use revenues from their low band network to make their midband network competitive.

**My** **rationale:**

Hyundai was already building the E-GMP platform in 2019 and was still actively seeking partners to develop future tech for skateboard and formed a partnership with Canoo to do exactly that. They indicated that this co-developed platform would be used in future vehicles. The E-GMP platform they eventually released seems way less advanced than Canoo's platform in the photos (e.g. it has struts vs Canoo's with leaf spring suspension), so the E-GMP platform could be the intermediate step until the co-developed platform is ready.

Apple tried to buy Canoo for it’s skateboard platform in 2020 and was turned down by Canoo. This makes a lot of sense for Apple because Canoo platform is really advanced (steer-by-wire, leaf spring suspension, crash test incorporated into skateboard, batteries incorporated into structure, very modular and fast development times/costs) and lets Apple focus on what they excel at, which is tech and quick development cycles.

Apple eventually forms a manufacturing partnership with Hyundai and it's rumored they're using Hyundai skateboard in the ""initial"" version, which is important because it signals they still want to use 3P skateboard. It seems that while they are likely using the E-GMP platform for the first iteration, the 2024 timeline easily puts them in line to use the new Canoo/Hyundai platform when it is done, which is consistent with the fact that Apple has already tried to purchase Canoo specifically for it's skateboard platform.

TL;DR 

1. Lenders/Bondholders are more likely to cut the firm some slack and/or renegotiate debt.
2. Attracting and keeping new employees becomes a little easier.
3. convertible debt converts to equity, at a higher price, reducing distress/default risk.
4. Existing employees see a rise in the value of their stock-based compensation, making them more likely to stay.
5. Issuing new stock at a higher price augments the value per share.
6. Cash proceeds from the issuance can be used to change business models (new investments &amp; acquisitions).

The metric the bond market is watching is the Treasury yield curve, or the difference between rates on various maturities, now at its steepest level since May 2017.

A steepening curve is typically viewed as a positive sign for the economy, the stock market and corporate earnings, while a flattening one is a warning for economic weakness.

The widely watched yield curve shows the difference between short- and long-term interest rates.

In this case, looking at the 2-year yield, now at 0.11% and the 10-year yield at 1.12%, the spread is 1.01 and edging higher with the rising 10-year yield. Rates move opposite “It’s being driven by the fact that policy, fiscal and monetary, is allowing there to be stronger economic growth for longer, without the Fed getting in the way, and that basically is allowing the economic cycle to extend further into the future,” said Jim Caron, head of global macro strategies on the global fixed income team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

There are expectations of rising inflation, and this is being priced into the market, he said.

VTI - Index tracking entire market. Dividend yield toughly 1.71%

SOXX/SMH - Index tracking semi-conductors. Also had good returns. Dividend yield roughly at 0.7%

SKYY/CLOU - Cloud based computing and internet of things

JETS - Airline industry. Good if bullish about airline recovery from covid

QQQ - Tracks the Nasdaq. Dividend yield roughly 0.55%

MTUM/IMTM - Tracks Momentum index.

Every Vanguard Stock (VTI, VUG, etc) - A lot to keep track of but just seem like large index funds that generally track entire market?

Luna Innovations: Underfollowed And Unloved, 17% Revenue Growth And 40% EBITDA Growth To Come

Luna Innovations is a unique, high-margin business with no competitors in many of its markets.

Forward revenue growth of 17% and operating leverage lead to 40% EBITDA growth.

160% upside to a 20x EBITDA multiple in 2023.


Luna Innovations (LUNA) is a unique business with abundant revenue growth and operating leverage. It currently trades at a value multiple and should rerate as its results show its inherent growth and profitability. Currently trading at a $265 million market cap with $26 million in net cash on the balance sheet, the company is underfollowed by Wall Street with only 2 analysts covering the name. LUNA trades at an Enterprise Value to Revenue (EV/R) ratio of 2.5x on 2021E revenue of $96 million, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 13.7x on 2021E EBITDA of $17.5 million. I believe these multiples are very low relative to the sustainable 15%+ top-line growth and 40% EBITDA growth of the company going forward.

Luna is a fiber optic testing company that uses fiber in a unique way. As such, it lacks head-to-head competition in many of its markets. This lack of competition is obviously a boon to pricing and margins but is also detrimental as no Wall Street analysts are incentivized to cover the company as it has no peers to amortize the coverage effort over or to compare to on a valuation basis. Luna’s business is split into two divisions, Lightwave and Luna Labs. In the September 2020 quarter, Lightwave comprised 73% of the total while Luna Labs made up 23%.


The Lightwave division sells fiber optic testing products and is itself split into two parts, Sensing and Non-Destructive Testing and Communications Test and Photronic Control. The Sensing business uses fiber optic strands as sensors and can measure strain, temperature, acceleration and vibration, and thickness over long distances. These capabilities can be used in many applications. For example, when the Polcevera Viaduct bridge in Genoa, Italy, was rebuilt after being destroyed in an earthquake, it was outfitted with fiber optic sensors and measurement systems from Luna to enable real-time health monitoring of the bridge. Luna works on a handful of similar projects each quarter but this pace could accelerate rapidly if a long-awaited infrastructure bill is passed in the United States. Smart infrastructure is topical now and Luna would likely benefit from any incremental projects in this area.

Another example of Luna’s Sensing technology was announced on 10/15 where Luna, in partnership with Shell’s (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) GameChanger early-stage-technologies program, developed, for the oil and gas industry, an “innovative concept for measuring in-situ stresses in subsurface rock using its fiber optic sensing solutions. When deployed, this technique would provide critical measurements with unmatched consistency and depth resolution, allowing safer and more efficient well operations.” While at a very early stage, this is a large opportunity for the company.

The company has a partnership with Meggitt (OTCPK:MEGGF), a large aerospace component supplier, to develop a fire sensor to be used on commercial and defense aircraft. Starting with new Airbus planes, these sensors will likely be retrofitted into the existing aircraft fleet over time. This opportunity has been pushed out somewhat due to Corona’s impact on the aerospace industry. While this is a long-term opportunity, it shows the breadth of industries that can take advantage of Luna’s technology.

Luna’s sensors are also used to detect material thickness in composite materials. In the B-22 Stealth Bomber, the anti-radar coating thickness must be uniform to work properly. Luna’s sensors can detect micron thickness abnormalities that would cause the bombers to show up on radar.

Luna also recently inked a deal with Land Rover where every new Land Rover Defender has a handful of Luna sensors on it to detect corrosion over time in different environmental conditions. This is an example of Luna’s sensors being used in production vehicles, not just test cases.


These Sensing examples demonstrate the wide range of end cases of Luna’s technology. This breadth results in 20%+ growth in this segment each year. The breakout opportunities include more production deals like Land Rover and Meggitt and the result of an infrastructure buildout in the US.

The Communication test business can detect and pinpoint flaws in fiber optic networks to the millimeter. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) uses Luna’s OBR 6200 to test the complex fiber optic networks on its F-22 fighter jets. While Lockheed has used a few of these testers in the past, it just placed an order for over 100 testers to be delivered this year. At a $65,000 ASP per tester, this amounts to an order of over $6 million, definitely enough to move the needle at a small company like Luna. There remains a large opportunity at Lockheed for testers to be used with its other aircraft and additional opportunity for testers to be used at other defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC).

Financial firms that facilitate high-speed trading are also customers of Luna. Luna’s testers can measure the exact length of the fiber route used in trading and also can detect any latency in such networks.

Luna’s testers are also important in the production of silicon photonics. These chips combine silicon circuitry with optical capability and are becoming more prevalent in optical networks. Luna can test these chips during their fabrication as well as when they are complete to ensure they perform up to specification.

Luna’s other division is called Luna Labs. Luna Labs uses government funding to research material science to produce innovative products that Luna can then use in its Lightwave division. This business is about 25% of Luna’s entire business.

Luna is experiencing a positive mix shift as its Lightwave business grows faster than its Luna Labs business. Gross margins in the Lightwave division are about 62% while gross margins in the Luna Labs business are about 28%. Lightwave is growing about 20% and Luna Labs is growing about 7%. Thus, over time, overall gross margins will rise as Lightwave becomes a bigger piece of the business. Also, overall revenue growth will improve as the faster-growing Lightwave business becomes a larger part of the overall pie.

What is the right way to think about valuation for this business? Without any true comps, it is necessary to look at absolute valuation for a growth company. We forecast revenue to grow at a 17% clip for the next few years and EBITDA to grow much faster, at a 40% rate as the company leverages its fixed cost structure. These assumptions result in $33 million in EBITDA in 2023 on a $131 million revenue base. Applying a growth multiple of 20x to that EBITDA gets you to a $21 share price, or about a 160% return from current levels.

Summary  


Sorrento Therapeutics has recently disclosed positive results in anti-COVID allogeneic adipose stem cells research.  
Sorrento Therapeutics is among the Nasdaq stocks with the highest short interest at 26.8%.  
I believe that the combination of a strong research pipeline with high short interest can lead to interesting returns.  
The GameStop (GME) short-squeeze drama has turned the spotlight on small- and mid-cap stocks with a high level of short interest. Heavily shorted stocks could become the target for so-called social trades by retail investors, who look to set off sharp price increases in these names and put pressure on short sellers, who need to buy shares they sold short to cover their positions.  


Retail traders are now looking for other stocks with similar characteristics to GME: a short interest standing at over 20% of the total float, a market cap of over $1 billion and a stock price of possibly $20 per share or less.  


I analyzed the Nasdaq looking for stocks that met those parameters and, among them, Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE) stood out.  


Company overview  
Sorrento Therapeutics is a clinical-stage and commercial biopharma company. The Company operates in three main areas: Immune-Oncology, Non-Opioid Pain Management and COVID-19.  


SRNE operates in the Immune-Oncology therapeutic area, leveraging its G-MAB antibody library and targeted delivery modalities to create the next generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), dimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (DAR-T), antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), as well as bispecific antibody approaches. Additionally, Sorrento Therapeutics' effort in the Immune-Oncology segment led to the development of Sofusa, a drug delivery technology that delivers biologics directly into the lymphatic system to potentially achieve improved efficacy and fewer adverse effects than standard parenteral immunotherapy."|investing|This post was found on twitter: Whether Sorrento Therapeutics could benefit from a short squeeze.|0.0|0.5

The Company’s platform will be used as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for government and corporate organizations globally

&amp;#x200B;

Drone tech is really hot sector right now and I feel this is immensely under valued. I am not going to make this post a long one, rather I will just list things good about this company.

&amp;#x200B;

* As I mentioned earlier drone industry is hot atm, look at UAVS, ALPP or BANT
* As part of the Company's technology roadmap, it plans to integrate various aspects of AI into its solution, including the use of AI in leveraging.
* Relaxed regulations for drone parcel delivery to take effect in March!
* The Company has created one of the healthiest balance sheets I've seen in a long time
* Included in 'OTC Markets Group Announces the 2021 OTCQX Best 50' awards.
* Currently trading around $1.1
* Todays volume has been a record.
* $0 DEBT!
* $20 million dollars in the bank.
* WSS has a price target of $6.5
* Undervalued 77%!

&amp;#x200B;

The list really goes on and on I will list all the refs for relevant info for you to look at, but one of the major news recently is that:

* **The Company is in discussions with various Federal and Provincial Government agencies and Canadian logistics providers and is hopeful to commercially participate with its advanced, patented drone delivery as the vaccine distribution plans start to roll out across Canada, and potentially internationally.**

I personally think this is HUGE!

&amp;#x200B;

CONS:

* Earnings have declined by 39.6% per year over past 5 years.
* Makes less than USD$1m in revenue (CA$63K).

&amp;#x200B;

'Whilst it's great to see that Drone Delivery Canada has already begun generating revenue from operations, last year it only produced CA$63k, so we don't think it is generating significant revenue, at this point. Therefore, for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on how the cash burn is tracking. While it hardly paints a picture of imminent growth, the fact that it has reduced its cash burn by 40% over the last year suggests some degree of prudence. Clearly, however, the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward.  As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Drone Delivery Canada's cash burn. In particular, we think its cash burn relative to its market cap stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending'

Right now there's been forays into AR with things google glass, and applications like Pokemon Go, and headsets (which I suppose are VR) like Oculus. There's projected overlays on car windshields. There are some iphone/android apps like Snapchat.

There's about a billion applications for AR. The simplest one that's already implemented in some respects is navigation. For instance, type in a destination, a line appears in the road in front of you and also in the distance you'll see a beacon of light. Another simple application would have little tags on your valuable items, put on the glasses and those tags appear bright and shiny. ""Where are my keys? Oh there they are."" Wacky idea, ar fish finder, put on the glasses look into the water, see the fish swimming. Google ads idea (or google nightmare idea) ""billboards"" appear on the horizon above businesses, or you buy the real estate in the space above your competitor and place your ""billboard."" (curious how much the real estate above buildings go for at this point, is there a market, where is that market, I suspect not many real estate folks are considering this implication). Nefarious use of data, color coding areas of town to show low income/high crime, or neighborhoods with better performing school scores; show where speed traps occur on the road. 

Point is you can spend hours/weeks coming up with ideas and applications for AR.

Again the technology and applications are going to be transformational, but at this time is it just too early to invest in AR? What companies do you invest in? Is it a good strategy to invest in companies that are researching the technology like Facebook, Google, Microsoft? In terms of the hardware do we just continue to invest in chip makers, optical component manufacturers, game hardware? Do we assume the software developers of today will be the same developers of the AR reality?

I wanted to shift gears away from the GME craze (though it is entertaining) and share my brief perspective on the up-and-coming biotech stock that is set to either increase significantly or rocket to the moon within this year. I have high expectations for Amarin Corp. ($AMRN). Let me start by saying, I am not a financial expert, nor is this financial advice, nor am I saying what to do with your monies. I am only a small time, working-man investor who has a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering, MPH in Biostatistics, am a certified PMP, and has 5+ years in therapeutic research and 2+ years in blood research. With that, here are my reasons on why people should seriously look at or invest in this company:

**TL;DR: $AMRN is a fast growing pharmaceutical company with great promise in growth, no debt a/o end of 2020, huge market monopoly, and large profits on the horizon. After, or during, the GME battle, AMRN could be a solid primary investment (low share price, but rising). They focus on heart cardiovascular health and their pilot drug reduces cardiovascular health issues by 25% and cardiovascular related deaths by 20%. Winner in the short and long run!**

**Amarin Corp ($AMRN)**

This is an Irish company that focuses on developing cost-effective (this is important for later) cardiovascular health therapeutics. Their main drug is VASCEPA which uses Icosapent Ethyl (cholesterol-regulating agent). Think of Icosapent Ethyl as a completely pure omega-3 oil you find in eating fish. In a study called REDUCE-IT (Link: [Academic Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/clc.22692)), they proved that this pure omega-3 oil reduced cardiovascular events by 25%(!) with combined use of a statin. They are FDA approved (which is the best thing for a drug company) and have patents protecting it (more on this in the Bears section). They have improved upon care coverage in 2020, been marketing heavily in Europe and China. The Chinese Society of Cardiology has included VASCEPA in treatment guidelines (Link: [Yahoo News Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vascepa-icosapent-ethyl-receives-further-113000209.html)). For COVID-19, $AMRN’s only drug has shown in a pilot study that reduces symptoms in outpatients. This is critical as COVID-19 affects the cardiovascular system heavily and causes major clotting to occur in severe cases (Link: [Pilot Study Overview](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/clinical-trials/2020/12/22/14/41/vascepa-covid-19-cardiolink-9)). I really believe in this company and just want to share their accomplishments and also give a more diverse investment outlook for everyone. GME may be the now, but AMRN is a potential stable future.

A/o, 02 Feb 21, they closed at $8.80 ($0.60/7.32%); 52-wk high of $19.22 and low of $3.36; and Short Volume Ratio of 16%.

**Bullish Thoughts:**

\- FDA Approved (Link: [FDA Announcement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-use-drug-reduce-risk-cardiovascular-events-certain-adult-patient-groups#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug,milligrams%20per%20deciliter%20or%20higher))!

\- They will most likely be approved for use in Europe within 2 months because they were given a positive opinion on 28 Jan 21 by the EMA (Links: [Amarin News Announcement](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-receives-positive-chmp-opinion-icosapent-ethyl) and [EMA Opinion Article](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/summaries-opinion/vazkepa)). Based on speculation, this approval could be mid-Feb to early Mar, but no later than end of Mar per EMA criteria (Link: [EMA FAQs Section \[Look under 'Questions about medicines'\]](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/about-us/frequently-asked-questions#questions-about-medicines-section)).

\- No other drug in this category can match their cost to benefit ratio ($1.79 per capsule or $430 for 240/$50 per prescription).

\- Application to be sold in China is almost guaranteed (finished Clinical Stage 3 w/ positive results) and already has a Chinese manufacturing/distribution partner (EddingPharm) (Link: [News Article](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/19/2130631/0/en/Amarin-Shares-Topline-Data-from-Partner-s-Pivotal-Phase-3-Study-of-VASCEPA-Icosapent-Ethyl-in-Mainland-China.html))

\- Generic companies cannot gain control in the EU and Chinese markets with this great cost to benefit ratio.

\- They are debt-free a/o the beginning of this year with $550 mil in cash and investments.

\- HUGE markets in EU and China compared to U.S.

\- 10 year minimum protection on their patents in the EU market.

**Bearish Thoughts:**

\- They lost 6 patents in the U.S. due to a lost lawsuit from 2 generic companies. It tanked the stock back in March, but I believe Wall Street overreacted because pharmacies rather buy the original/cheap drug over a generic (Link: [News Article Link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amarin-loses-patent-appeal-in-vascepa-lawsuit-stock-dips-2020-09-04)).

\- They are suing a generic and insurance company for manipulating the market of their drug, patent infringement, and drug coverage manipulation. Though it seems a sure bet they will win, it is still a 50/50 chance they will succeed (link: [Amarin News Announcement](https://investor.amarincorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amarin-expands-cardiovascular-risk-reduction-patent-infringement)).

\- They are struggling with selling the product in the U.S. There is high demand, but not enough sales coverage.

\- VASCEPA is their ONLY product with no other pipelines. This opens them up to be boxed in by competition.

Longer version

My investment strategy is finding a stock that will perform well in medium/long term. I usually try to take profits or cut losses within one year, so look for companies that should benefit from what is happening around the world (be it Covid, green revolution, retail industry tendencies). Today I’ll share my opinion about future of deliveries.

For quite a while there has been a buzz around drone deliveries. Be it Amazon Prime Air, UPS Flight Forward, DHL Parcelcopter (my favorite because of this ridiculous name), Boeing’s Matternet… Everyone with the capacity to is trying to jump on this ship. You can read more about latest developments and companies working in Source 1.

Why there’s such race to develop unmanned cargo air vehicles and autonomous flight technology you might ask? Well, drone doesn’t get sick, can workday and night, it doesn’t have to take breaks or spend half of it’s time chatting around or staring at its phone. It also doesn’t need any contributions to its pension fund or healthcare insurance (needs insurance nevertheless, but technical insurances should come at much better rate than insuring a ball of flesh against all that world could throw at it). Finally, drones don’t care if there’s pandemic raging outside or boogaloo boys are stepping on the grass around some government building.

Drone comes off for the buyer as a one-time purchase cost, thus saving loads of cash in the lung run. Many businesses are taking more ‘green’ approach to their business and calculate their CO2 footprint. Given that drones are powered by electricity (all the attention to the renewable energy, wink wink) it would also help business to boast about reducing carbon footprint while improving their efficiency.

One might think of one issue here: drones are cool and stuff, but what about the battery - it might not be able to cover required distance? Worry not, there are already solutions for this. Mainly ultra-fast charging stations (charge time: 5 minutes) or wireless charging hotspots (charge time: 6 minutes). Check out Source 2 and Source 3.

All in all I believe that drones have a bright future ahead of them and $*TAKOF* is one of the players in this industry.

**Company**: Founded in 2014, Drone Delivery Canada has developed a proprietary and patented turnkey drone delivery solution. The company is fully commercialized, operational, and revenue generating.

DDC has developed a drone delivery platform solution which is cost effective, highly scalable and can provide next generation logistic services to various market sectors including: retail, ecommerce, parcel &amp; post, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, mining, oil &amp; gas, logistics companies, Indigenous Communities, military and government agencies, in Canada and internationally. The Company’s patented, fully integrated hardware/software platform is used as a managed service in a SaaS business model. Drone Delivery Canada is fully commercialized, operational and revenue-generating, with a robust sales funnel of global prospects. [https://dronedeliverycanada.com](https://dronedeliverycanada.com/)

So far, the company has signed test flight agreements with several major corporations. A medical facility in Ontario, two remote First Nations communities in the same province, GlobalMedic, and Air Canada have all agreed to test the company’s drones. Last year, it also struck a partnership with European logistics/transport group DSV Panalpina A/S.

**Latest Catalysts**: Drone Delivery Canada plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its disruptive drone delivery solution (Source 4); Drone Delivery Canada has been named to the 2021 OTCQX® Best 50 (Source 5); In January 2021, the FAA added new rules to 14 CFR Part 107 to permit the expansion of routine flights and created four categories of UAS for flights over suburban/urban areas (Source 6)

**Upcoming Catalysts**: release of Q4 and 2020 results; in July company started process to entering US market – at some point there will be announcement if this is a success.

**Industry Catalyst**: establishment of a legal basis for unmanned cargo air vehicles, battery technology and wireless charging developments.

Research by Goldman Sachs suggests the market potential could be as big as US$100 billion (CA$130 billion). Meanwhile, startups in the sector are nearly all worth less than $1 billion today (source 7 – claims $*TAKOF* has multi-bagger also discusses $*TAKOF* cash position).

**Summary**: $*TAKOF* is ready for a take off! It’s literally in their name.

Seriously, given all the craziness in the current market I wouldn’t rule out this reaching $10 in the next months. Especially if expansion to US is confirmed.

My position: 1k shares at $1.22

Currently I've decided to start researching holiday/travelling market as I expect (I know its very optimistic) Covid to start easing off by the end of the year and so naturally travelling and holiday sectors should bounce back.

Accor Hotels caught my eye with surprisingly low share price currently. I think I must be missing something. Ok, so corona happened and of course the hotel chains got hit hard. Fair enough, their financial report for 2020 looks dreadful.

However, I've looked at their previous financial reports and I've seen a stable growth pattern. From 2018 to 2019 their revenue jumped by almost 15%. I'd say that is really impressive. In addition to that, before corona in 2019 they've started expanding their portfolio and diversifying which I thought was a great move.

Now, talking about share price, Accor currently sits at 29euros in the Paris stock exchange which is roughly $35 a share. Now, in comparison, in 2019 Starwood (which was acquired by Marriot recently) traded at almost $90 a share when in reality they are smaller than Accor and doesn't boast the same capital and assets as Accor does. Before corona, Accor's share price was floating around 40euros.

Am I right to assume they are undervalued and there is money to be made here long term or is it just because they are not floating on New York Stock Exchange and thus doesn't have the same potential demand for shares as an American chain like Starwood was?"|investing|Accor Hotels, what am I missing?|4.0|0.71

Over the past year, I’ve also began actively trading in riskier short term stocks. Some of those active trades grew well beyond what I could have ever imagined, up where I was sitting on VERY large in unrealized gains. While it’s not money I would have used short term, it would have been amazing to have. 

I always go beyond my exit strategy because I always say “what if it keeps going up and I keep getting greedy. Essentially it gets to the point when I tell my significant other I’m up X on this stock and before I know it the price is much less than I could have gotten. I get out with a profit, but it’s never close to what I originally could have had. 

Then, there are times where I’ve sold too soon. And could have had somewhat life changing money if I just held on 3 or 6 more months. 

I’ve always hated stop losses because I feel like sometimes the stock bounces right back up after a little dip. 

Essentially, I’m wondering the following:

1. How do you deal with massive loss of unrealized gains? Right now I’m just mad at myself, but know if I made it once, I can do it again but just shouldn’t chase. 

2. How do you fight the urge to keep holding when you know you should get out? 

3. Do you have any stop loss strategies? Ex: in 25% increments of total investment?

4. How do you move on and not fall in love with that specific stock? I would think I constantly keep checking it and seeing what I could have had.

* Portfolio has leveraged upside
* Risk is limited to the premium
* No risk of margin calls
* Realizing profits on a regular basis

Cons:

* Risk of losing entire premium with nothing to show for it when option is way OTM when it's time to roll over
* Tax implications?

Although short interest has increased for the stock (roughly 10%), different analyst reports have set target prices for gap anywhere from 19 to 27 dollars, and so I think it is a relatively stable stock right now. 

What I really think is going to boost this stock is the upcoming Yeezy collaboration with Gap. This collaboration was announced in July 2020 and is reported to be a 10 year deal. The target release date was slated to be first half of 2021. Aside from a small leak of potential designs in October 2020, there has been no news ever since. 

One thing I know about Yeezy branded stuff, is that it gets instantly sold out whenever there is a new drop. Despite the intentional pivot to affordable clothing ($50-100 for an item instead of $300-500), I truly believe that Yeezy Gap will also see similar supply and demand issues. 

None of the market reports I have read mention Yeezy at all.

Let's say I want to spend a constant amount of money in ETF's every week (very risk averse). I could do this either by buying for market value (market order) or by placing an offer for a fixed amount of money (limit order). Wouldn't it be smartest to place a limit order every week, by calculating the variance of the price per week over the last year and just place that bet that has a 95% change to actually hit that low? Thereby profiting from the almost inevitable fluctuation of the stocks?

The only case of when you would lose money is when you actually wanted to buy but it didn't happen because the stocks went up (5% of the cases). But then you will have invested the week before that, so there is no drama at all.

US Steel – 42M new shares &amp; strategy: ~1400 words or 7-20 minutes at ~150 WPM, add 15 minutes if you check the links, which you should as a best practice.

Hey everyone,

I’ve enjoyed the bit of attention to my posts on my bullish analysis on US Steel (X), and I wanted to do another somewhat brief write-up in response to news hot off the press. Another reddit user pointed out that they just issued 42 million shares – I have never encountered this before as a stock I’ve analyzed so I figured I’d do some research as I constantly strive to develop my investing strategy. I’ve got a ton of links for y’all so you can fact check and do your damn due diligence (D^4). This is compared to a previous 220M shares so if you take it at face value before additional considerations it’s a roughly 20% dilution. We’re going to use that number for valuation.

Analysis: Instead of holding onto cash, either for investment purposes in new facilities or to pay current debt or handle other volatility, X issued a dividend. A microscopic dividend. In considering the cause, an intuitive answer I’ve come up with is as a bullish indicator of strength. They have solid enough financials to pay this small dividend as a hey, take this for now, there’s more to come – as opposed to a 0.

Historical context(lots of links)

https://www.investopedia.com/us-steel-stock-hits-all-time-low-4799379

If you’ve paid any attention to my posts, X or just entered “X Stock” into Google or Bing and looked at the historical value of the stock, you will see that the share went up to the 170s in 2008 (holy fuck), and then post-crash it went down to around $16.70. I haven’t been able to find the steel index for as far back as 2008, but presumably it was pretty good for X to be that profitable, pre-crash. I did find however data for the last 6 years which I think tells a compelling story.

By 2010, the stock went back up to a high of 63.44 – a 400% ROI if you bought at the low of 16.70.

2015 – down to a terrible low of 6.15 which I believe is lowest in stock history.

2016: This is where things get really interesting. In January CRU is around the 390s/ low 400s, and X is around $7. By June, CRU is at 628 in that 6 months (50% increase in CRU), but X is up to 16.86 (250% ROI). It makes sense that a stock will go up if their product goes up sharply, but that disproportionate increase relates to some degree to the static fixed costs making the overall profit margin much higher. If you held on an additional month to July, X went to 27.49 for over 400% ROI in 7 months.

In 2018 we see X start the year around 39, peak at 45ish and then make a steady decline with some volatility all the way down until 2020. On the CRU side we see 675 in mid Jan to a peak of about 915 6-7 months later in June / July. There seems to be some sort of mismatch with X stock going down while CRU went up. Of note is that around 2018, the Big River plant started ($1.9 billion) and was completed in 19 months. I’m not going to spend weeks on research, but some ideas I have for the mismatch are 1) Investors already baked-in the rising CRU into the stock, 2) there was a drop in the dow from 26.5 to 23s/24s – perhaps construction and auto went down around that time, and perhaps we 3) see some significant investment spending and 4) investors factored in upcoming world-supply of steel as manufacturers built out capacity (China flooding world steel market, eager to take out our industry) 5) I’ve read about some X hiccups over the years.

In 2018 versus 2017 we see an increase in net earnings of 523M (9 months ended September) versus 228 in 2017 (9 months ending September), a 250% increase), and they did capital expenditures of 640M versus 291 in 2017 (roughly 250%). When they made big money, they invested it. Overall stockholders equity went up from 9.86B to 10.56B, debt increased by about 85B in total (lots of debt added and lots of debt paid in various categories)

https://www.quandl.com/data/CHRIS/CME_HR1-U-S-Midwest-Domestic-Hot-Rolled-Coil-Steel-CRU-Index-Futures-Continuous-Contract-1-HR1-Front-Month

From 2018 to 2020 we see a steady decrease with a lot of volatility that I’m sure people made big money on (swings of 20-50% 1-3 months multiple times).

Where things get really spicy – 2019 &amp; 2020 (page 2,3)

https://s26.q4cdn.com/153509673/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/84575751-ec61-49fb-a8c8-fc059b707a23.pdf

2019 and 2020 start out terrible – 2020 by September has a loss of 1.2B versus net income of 38M in 2019. Yikes. We do however see that the total assets increased slightly from 11.6B to 11.7B. So they did a decent job at not selling off their income sources. Note that they went from 750B cash and cash equivalents to 1.7B (250%). Someone did a damn good job picking up liquidity – they haven’t been around since 1900ish for no reason! 

 

End of 2020 – really important (pages 5,6,7)

https://s26.q4cdn.com/153509673/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/2021-005-UNITED-STATES-STEEL-CORPORATION-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2020-RESULTS.pdf

 

Despite a terrible year, financial magic takes X from a low of 750M cash assets in Dec 2019 back to 2B in 2020 – X has a demonstrated ability to generate lots of liquidity. The overall year has a loss of 1.17B, which isn’t surprising since the first 3 quarters were just terrible. Note 725M in capital expenditures in 2020 despite the rough year financing – someone in charge knows that there are things worth investing in (additional Big River-style plants?!?) It is NOW in the 4th quarter and 2021 that things are back to looking up again. By all measures steel appears to be cyclical and X has overall very sharp relation to the CRU index.

 

Now / TLDR: Steel hit a historical high of 1150 in the last day. X stock has in multiple cycles achieved a 250% to 400% ROI from lows to CRU peaks which typically occur around 6-7 months later. CRU index goes down as China pumps out steel – but Trump Tariffs &amp; corporatist Biden seems likely to keep tariffs in place – the CEO of X in the recent earnings call seemed very confident that tariffs would remain in place – let’s be honest, someone probably talked to someone behind a closed door, their was fancy cheese and fancier alcohol, probably golf a technically-illegal cigar. All of my optimism for the stock’s value over next 6-7 months does not heavily factor in a successful infrastructure US government plan but that would be best case scenario.  Overall, I still believe that X is likely to reach the 30s-40s within the next 6-7 months barring some exceptional crisis. More than that, I have a suspicion that they are building up cash reserves to try to roll-out additional Big-River style plants. X went down to 16.50 today which I think is a nice discount for buy-in. I also think that even if X doesn’t shoot up this year, the hype around additional plants will mean healthy increases into the 20s and 30s over next 2 years – the Big River plant is apparently the first of its kind – see quote below – in a few ways. I think the upwards potential from overall economic conditions outweighs the dilution from shares issued – these executives aren’t stupid, they are doing what they believe will increase the share’s value and companies health. They have a demonstrated aptitude for managing liquidity and building capacity even in downturns.

Exact short interest is beyond reach for most of us, but we can get a good estimate from services like Ortex. From my experience, they are usually within 10% of the exchange reported interest, and they're a good ballpark for sentiment.

I work in the auto repair industry. Our franchise saw an insane boost of traffic following the closure of the walmart auto care centers. Some of which remain closed as walmart took a low-risk approach to covid. Rightly so, because many of the people who have been working on cars have caught covid. They're just not reporting the cases. It's one of those fields that flew under the radar in regulation.

I believe that as walmart ramps up the re opening of their auto care centers, they're earning reports are going to skyrocket. The wal mart auto care center is the largest competition in regards to automotive repair as they do offer some wildly low prices on shit. 

The fact they have done so well after shutting down such a major function of their stores shows they have thrived in other areas.

1612377927.0|0.0|t3_lbutro|7.0|"The sentiment among both retail investors and institutional investors seems to be that growth is king.

This is mostly fueled by the fact that companies such as Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, AMD, and Facebook have appreciated in value substantially faster than ""value"" stocks such as T, VZ, LUMN, KR. Investors see the returns growing companies provide, and project similar trends. If investing in Tesla provided a 10x return in a year, why invest in a boring stagnant company like AT&amp;T that pays a 7% dividend and lost value?

To me, this seems very reminiscent of 1999/2000, where fast growing tech companies were valued tremendously high. Much like now, the idea was earnings would keep growing, so these high valuations would be justified by high earnings in the future. Investors seem very much focused on ""investing in the companies of the future"" and thus prices have grown much faster than earnings have.

One common misconception is that in 2000, the bubble was all unprofitable tech companies with no feasible business model, whereas today, growth companies like Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft are profitable.

While companies with bad business models crashed the hardest, profitable tech companies were still overvalued in 2000 too. 

Cisco, for example, was profitable in 1999, yet it dropped in value by 75%, and still has not recovered from 2000 highs.

Contrast that with a ""boring"" non-tech value company like Walmart, which barely budged during the tech bubble crash.

Share appreciation is an important aspect of total returns, but share appreciation is entirely dependent on investor sentiment. 

Right now, enthusiasm for growth is at record highs. Investors are willing to buy unprofitable companies with the expectation they will grow rapidly and eventually become a profitable giant, and they can sell for more.

It's important to ask yourself- what happens if this sentiment disappears as it did in 2000? Suppose investors suddenly decide paying over 60x annual revenue and over 600x EPS for a company like Shopify is no longer justified, and the price of such growth stocks drops 75%. Are you comfortable with that?

In my opinion, growth is important, but the best way to value a stock fairly is to base it on the assumption that you can't sell it for 100 years, but any capital returned to shareholders can be reinvested either back into the company, or elsewhere using the discount rate you chose to discount value of distributions. 

When you do that, it takes swings in investor sentiment out of the question. You're no longer vulnerable to market volatility. The question becomes ""will this company provide a positive return given a discount rate on future cash flows?""

If the answer to that question is ""no"", then you're basing your entire investment on faith that the market will be continue to place a high valuation on growth and be willing to pay excessively for it. if that sentiment remains, great, you can profit. But if it doesn't, then you're stuck either holding the bag on an illiquid investment, or selling for a loss.

It is my view that in the next decade, value stocks with low P/E ratios in less cyclical industries(ie consumer staples, telecommunications), will experience lower volatility than growth stocks with negative earnings or high P/E ratios, due to having consistent cash flows to back up valuations.

I believe a handful of growth companies that do extraordinarily well will outperform a broad basket of value based companies, but the majority will not."|investing|CMV: Growth stocks are becoming a bubble and present more downside risk than non-cyclical value stocks|7.0|0.89

**Technical:**

I see a lot of similarities between SPCE and GME in terms of short interest and buying pressure. I believe shorts are covering as SI dropped from ~78% to [~72% recently] (https://www.highshortinterest.com/), and will continue to cover. This is seen in the voluminous buying. Unlike GME and AMC, which have seen a decrease in volume recently, SPCE continues to have high volume, green days. 

I also see a similar pattern in daily trading as I did in GME: A 15%-20% run up to around noon, then a 5-10% drop and a leveling off for the rest of the day. Perhaps shorts cover up to noon and purposes kill of momentum after?

&amp;nbsp;


**Why I invested:**

*  The largest upside I see in Lumen's future growth is their fiber infrastructure. Depending on what source you reference, Lumen either has the largest fiber network in the US or is in the top 3 along with AT&amp;T and Verizon. In either case, the need for larger, wider-reaching fiber networks will only grow in the future. In my opinion, 5G will be the springboard that propels the next great leap in technological advances. 

&amp;nbsp;

* [Tier 1 network provider (Approx. 7 in the US)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network), ranked [#1 in terms of CAIDA AS Rank (The CAIDA AS Rank is a rank of importance on the internet)](https://asrank.caida.org/). What that means: They provide/have the capability to provide the most internet connections to direct customers (other smaller networks(Tier 2) and indirect customers/end users (even smaller networks (Tier 3) and eventually you and I). 
  * Maybe an analogy to help better explain this is to think of it like railroads (I know it is much more complicated, especially with railroads, but simplifying for this purpose).
      * BNSF (Tier 1 Network in this case) owns, maintains and uses the rail lines (fiber network) between Seattle and Chicago. They have trains running regularly but their rail lines are far from being congested so they allow smaller rail transport companies to use their tracks for a fee.
      * Amtrak (Tier 2 Network) cant afford to build/maintain their own cross country rail lines but have passengers they need to get from Seattle to Chicago. So they pay BNSF to use their rail lines to efficiently get their customers to their destination.


          ^ To tie up this example for network traffic, there are only 7 Tier 1 networks and all smaller companies need them to provide service to their customers.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
* 9.5% annual dividend yield (very high relative to market) 

 - Per multiple reports I've read, this number does not seem sustainable, but [they actually have been doing this while also paying off their debts.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LUMN/lumen-technologies/debt-equity-ratio) 

&amp;nbsp;

**What this all adds up to:**

Their share price has suffered over the past decade because CenturyLink was unfocused while also being obligated to provide dying services (landline) and trying to compete with other ISPs. While they have held and made new substantial infrastructure investments in fiber and network services, the business was not focused on where they can increase profitability.

&amp;nbsp;

Enter rebranding to Lumen in September 2020. They have been and will continue to trim the fat through reorganization/restructuring to focus on their network services and enterprise solutions. Their available infrastructure has them well positioned for growth as their fiber internet becomes more widely available and increased demand with 5G networks emerging.

&amp;nbsp;

All of this on top of the expectation that their nearly 10% dividend yield should bolster an investment in the short term while their growth goals materialize.

https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/all-weather-portfolio/

I like the all weather approach compared to a split of bonds and stock index funds because you cover all the seasons of the market. 

I know the large debate over long term leveraged ETF's are volatility and leverage decay, plus putting all of your money into one such as SSO (purely the stock market) is that in the long term it will lead to your demise.

But by covering multiple fronts are you not reducing the risk of a overall downturn in your portfolio? On top of that bull markets last much longer than bear markets and there are times when all the ""seasons"" are going up. Where as when one sector goes down, another usually goes up (stocks and bonds).

Another argument is that some people can't stomach the higher volatility in an account such as your retirement.

I can see if you're looking to liquidate your assets in the next 5 years that you'd want to have a less volatile approach but for someone not looking to touch the money and put in monthly contributions I can see this being a great long-term investment.

# Background

XBiotech is a company that has been around for over 15 years. They started out by developing antibody-drugs to combat viral and bacterial infectious diseases. On December 30, 2019 they sold their „ IL-1⍺ blocking True Human™“  antibody based drug, which was successful in treating dermatological diseases. They sold the drug to J&amp;J for **$750 million in upfront cash and up to $600 million paid over the next years**. These news doubled the stock's market cap from about $300 to $600 million.  Just the revenue from this deal alone will give them over $50 million yearly revenue with minimal additional costs. This alone is in my opinion worth **at least** a market cap of $750 million (For the next 10 years the company has at least about $1.2 billion in cash, yearly -$20-40 Million operations ≈ $750 million)

However, with this deal the company is not allowed to work on further dermatological applications with their „ IL-1⍺True Human“ drug. - at first glance, this hinders the companies potential to grow massively, thus (paired with the covid mass selling) the stock dropped down in early 2020 to pre-deal levels within one month. Investors slowly came to their senses and the stock recovered now, Feb 2021 to almost $600 mio market cap again

# Why is this company undervalued?

It seems to me that not everybody is aware that the company actually is allowed to do further treatments with their IL-1⍺ True Human technology - they are only restricted in dermatology. 

„Completed clinical studies and a myriad of scientific research have shown that blocking IL-1⍺ may have a beneficial effect in numerous medical conditions. The potential unmet medical need for blocking inflammation through neutralizing IL-1⍺ is vast. **The Company plans to re-enter the clinic with more than one additional anti-IL-1⍺ therapy, beginning in early 2021**“.  \[[http://www.xbiotech.com](http://www.xbiotech.com)\] 

They are in collaboration with several hospitals, namely University Hospital Zürich where they are using their overflow of cash to rapidely develop therapies for cancer and liver diseases as well as strokes. 

**These are some drugs they are working on:**

\- Animal trials showed that IL-1⍺ can treat inflammations of brain tissue after a stroke. =&gt;If this works, this will be a true breakthrough in the field.

\- Phase II for treatment against bacterial infection (Staphylococcus Aureus infection: [https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/infections/bacterial-infections-gram-positive-bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus-infections](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/infections/bacterial-infections-gram-positive-bacteria/staphylococcus-aureus-infections)). =&gt; Already Phase II and the potential market for this is very encouraging

\- Phase I: for several cancer types =&gt; Could explode the stock or not end up working 

\- Phase I: antibody therapy vs COVID, worked in laboratory conditions better than the antibody therapy from Eli Lilly (Antibody therapy is what Trump got to recover from COVID so quickly). =&gt;Just recently they showed that XBiotech's drug works just as well against the COVID mutation. 

This are just a few exapmles. From all of these there should be news in the upcoming months. Any of those having success will be **huge** for a company with a market cap of currently $560 million

# Catalysts (conservative numbers)

\- Seasoned company that has worked on this drug for 15 years and finally got the breakthrough

\- lots of cashflow: estimated of at least $300 million by then end of 2021

\- yearly payments from J&amp;J of \~$50 mio for phase II study for treating dermatological diseass (see above)

\-HBM Healthcare investments, a well known, professional investor are holding 6 % stake in the company

\-COVID will likely last for at least another 1-2 years, this is plenty of time to get value out of their antibody therapy. Even when covid is over, the seasonal flu kills millions of people all over the world and the market for this drug is therefore enormous. 

# My Price Target:

Just looking at the deal with J&amp;J and the potential from the increased cashflow I would set the very conservative price target BEFORE new announcements to **$25**. If they announce Phase II for any of the above mentioned products, or even a final product, it is hard to predict the price target without any details right now. Given the market size, cash flow and previous success of the company I would say between **$100-$150 USD** a share.  


# Final Remarks

In my opinion, XBiotech does not compare to recently hyped (not saying they are bad) biotech companies such as (SENS,BNGO, etc.). Xbiotech will stay in business for many more years for sure. It is a more save alternative with comparable upside to other small biotech companies.

I still don't know the full extent of the ramifications this will have on the markets and investing going forward but regardless, this served as a prime example (for me at least) that it isn't always worth jumping on the bandwagon even if there seemingly is no downside potential.

However, the greater lesson for me is learning to exercise restraint and caution. With social media having so much power and influence over people it has really stressed the importance of understanding each investment you make and being intentional with your decisions. I was fortunate enough to come out of all this with only a small loss and I feel additionally fortunate that I didn't have enough capital to turn this valuable learning experience into irreversible financial damage. I understand investing isn't for everyone and some people just came in to make a quick buck (which is also okay), but I still encourage you to learn the ropes and look past the bullshit as it can be a valuable skill to have in the future.

So I was looking into European EV companies and I stumbled upon NAVYA: top leading French EV company. They sell mainly self-driving shuttles for passengers. So far, this is not impressive. HOWEVER , what impressed me the most is their technology.

To put things into perspective, EV automation ranges from level 1 to level 5(the highest -&gt; full automation). Tesla’s technology is currently a level 2 and NAVYA has an impressive level 4 automation! Their technology is simply amazing.

I believe no one is talking about NAVYA because it located in France and is not listed in American market.

Nevertheless, I believe it’s a great opportunity to invest. What do you think?

I have seen many good quality DD about Corsair. We all know it’s a great business. 

What I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**

Corsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). 

Here’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33) 

**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document 

  **For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:** 

**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million** 

**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**

**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**   
 

Yes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…

In fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

For the full year 2020, we currently expect: 

• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.

• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. 

• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  

Then, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)): 

For the full year 2020, we currently expect:

* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.
* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.
* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.  
 

**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). 

As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.

In the more recent prospectus (page 10): 

*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*   
 

**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). 

(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))

   
At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).

This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).

\-----

Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!

I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! 

No f\*\*\* way!!!

Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). 

Someone shared it on reddit

They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

So today was rough for those in the GME trade.  I, for example, cracked jokes in the comments to my last post about how my remaining GME holdings went from new Lexus money, through Corolla money, and briefly delved to the depths of used golf cart money.  At one point I mentioned maybe ending up with a Razor scooter in the end, but luckily ended the day with Polaris RZR type money instead.

I wasn't paying attention to the pre-market action, but right the start of normal market hours it looked like an avalanche of panic selling.  Looking back at the chart, seeing the consistent downward march of price, the gap down into early pre-US market, immediate drop at 7am pre-market, it shouldn't have been too surprising.  Likely a number of people who are unable to trade pre-market were just watching their numbers move in the wrong direction for hours before they got the chance to bail, and that's what happened immediately once the option was available.

In my previous post I had identified $150/$148 as what I thought might be the ""retail line of defense"".  Given the immediate open below, there was no solid support or consolidation around any level, though some hyper aggressive buying put the floor in at $74.22 at around 10:45.  I'm honestly not sure what to make of that remarkable move.   Likely it staunched the bleeding somewhat, repairing retail morale temporarily.  Once that parabolic arc slammed into the LULD halt, price action reversed and resumed a steady march downward.

So, where does that leave things at this point?  With respect to a squeeze, which I've been asked about quite a bit over the past few hours, my concern is the unlocking of so much float, given what I have to interpret as heavy panic selling.  As I covered in the Market Mechanics post, locking of liquid float is paramount and today was certainly not a help in that regard.  That being said, as I pointed out in that post, locking up the float gets cheaper at lower prices, so we shall see what happens over the next few days.

So what's next?  I don't know, and no one else does either.  Yes, that tired old answer I give in just about every post.  The thing is, it's true.  The events over the past couple of weeks have certainly reinforced that fact to me.

As with yesterday, I've been variously accused of being a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pumper and dumper, which again I take as indicating a healthy balance.  One thing I promise is that I will call it like I see it, and admit to any mistakes I make.

# Knowledge and Responsibility

Watching events unfold today had me thinking quite a bit.  About the debates across this sub and others, the media, etc.  As I've mentioned previously in comments, my purpose in creating this account was to try to help provide some information, education, and a space for healthy discussion for in particular all of the newer traders that were flocking to this particular trade.  I've been very happy to read the numerous comments and messages from various people who have expressed that they feel they've been able to learn quite a bit in a very compressed timeframe due to the intensity of focus on the situation.

I have been told by some that rather than discuss this trade or the mechanics behind it at all, I should simply flat out tell people to stay away because of the risk, and speak of it no more.  I have to admit, I was conflicted about this, because the risk is very high, as I've always stated.

That being said, I believe that participation in the market is one of the most important rights people should have, and equal participation in the market requires knowledge, transparency, and information.  You are all free to make our own choices.  Whatever others may say, You *will* make your own choices.  At least we can try to help each other make those choices with the best information we have available.

Hah, I managed to keep this post at least a little shorter!  As mentioned previously, I will probably have to keep it that way for a while due to real life responsibility.  Thank you all in advance for the great discussion.

Man, rocket rides can sure be bumpy, but it's been the most interesting week in the market I've ever seen.  Let's see what the day brings!

EDIT:  

Guys! I did try my best to reply to your comments. Here is a Video showing how the process works. Of course this is very simplified: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEb2urm2wTw)

I hope this helps you better understand what it's all about. Please inform yourself well before you invest. I do not recommend investing to anyone who does not believe in the idea. This company can also fail, you are warned. I welcome all others who are sure that this project will conquer the market.

**What is it about?**

I've been watching an interesting company since December 2020 that advertises with the following slogan: ""We exist to decarbonize the currently high carbon production footprint of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles."" The company is called Vulcan Energy Resources\[1\].

ISIN: AU0000066086

WKN: A2PV3A

**How did you find the company?**

I became aware of the company because I see that there is a trend towards sustainable investing\[2\]. So I started looking for a company that appealed to me. At some point I came across an article that a project was underway to extract lithium without damaging the environment\[3\]. Gripped by the topic, I spent several days trying to find out what was going on and what it was all about.

**What about sustainability?**

ZERO CARBON LITHIUM: The project is called Zero Carbon Lithium\[4\] and is being driven by Vulcan Energy Resources as mentioned above. The current main way to extract and refine lithium, from hard rock mines, will emit about 1.05 billion tons of CO2 to produce the amount of lithium needed to electrify all the world's passenger cars. Unlike current lithium extraction methods, Zero Carbon Lithium will have virtually no impact on the public or the environment. That means no large open pit mines, no large, unsightly, water-guzzling evaporation ponds, or process plants that run on fossil fuels.

After reading that, I was hooked for now. But not yet ready to invest. Moreover, the share was still a penny stock at the time. That was too risky for me. So I looked weekly to see if something is about to happen.

**The Decision:**

Investing based on an idea is never a good idea, so I took a close look at the company and the idea:

1. Since I already had a bad experience once, with such a young idea, I first looked how often and how well information is published\[5\]. Surprisingly, it is published diligently and everything fits so far. ✔
2. Publishing is one thing, the other is whether there is something behind it. Since listed companies have a disclosure obligation, it is easy to see whether the figures from the Investor Centre correspond to those on the stock exchange\[6\]. ✔
3. Financially, you can't do an analysis á la Warren Buffet here. The company is still young, and has a lot to invest. Nevertheless, I took a look at what is going on. Quick Analysis: More assets than liabilities ✔. Equity consistently increased ✔. Cash flow and net income: naturally in the red due to the investments ✖. More does not make sense here, as said value investing does not work here.
4. Vulcan operates a lot of geothermal plants and is familiar with the matter. So there is internal and independent expertise in geothermal and lithium on site for project execution\[7\]. ✔
5. Location - the right market, compelling supply-demand dynamics: being at the center of the European lithium ion battery industry is a major advantage for a semi-bulk product. Europe will be the world's fastest-growing lithium ion battery production center in the 2020s, with no local supply of lithium hydroxide.\[7\] ✔
6. Positive framework study: world-leading industry experts in lithium extraction and geothermal energy are behind the first study of its kind, which provides a solid foundation for the start of feasibility studies planned soon.\[7\] ✔
7. I understood how the process works and read the feasibility study.Not only lithium is extracted but also other rare metals\[9\]. ✔

If you go through my sources with interest, you will see that there is a very solid basis behind the project. But what was the deciding point for me to invest was the fact that Vulcan intentionally requested a trading halt while they were conducting the study to prevent wild speculation. This happened once in January2021\[9\] and once now around February 2021\[10\]. I got in in January because that was a sign to me that Vulcan was serious.

In addition, Vulcan gave a presentation to the EU Commission, with positive feedback. Vulcan has signed a binding agreement with the EU-funded EIT InnoEnergy as part of the Business Investment Platform (BIP) of the European Battery Alliance (EBA) initiative of the European Commission. This agreement is expected to significantly accelerate the momentum of Vulcan's Zero Carbon Lithium project. The project is located in Germany, at the center of the fastest growing lithium market in the world: the European battery industry for electric vehicles \[11\].

**What's in store for the future?**

I can't see into the future, of course, but I am sure that with this project electric vehicles will gain significant momentum. Also, the EU would be more independent and I personally like that a lot. In addition, there is no need to dry salt lakes or make bad environmental cuts like in other countries. I also see it critically that we consume here, and in mines at the other end of the world people have to work life-threatening for our luxury.

**Is $VUL the next $GME?**

Please, this is not a comparison. This is about the environment and the future of next generations. I am against PUMP&amp;DUMP! If you are convinced of a company you invest and don't gamble!

**Is now the right time?**

I do not know. You have to decide that for yourself. I am invested myself in the meantime, because I am convinced of the idea therefore I will hold the share also with fluctuations. I got in at \~4.00 - 5.00€.

1612337274.0|0.0|t3_lbib0x|299.0|"The idea that hedge funds are lowering the price of certain stocks through coordinated ""short ladder attacks"" has been all over reddit the past couple of days. I've heard multiple versions of the story about how these work, all of which go something like this:
&gt; To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.

**The TL;DR here is that short ladder attacks don't exist.** Due to the way the market is structured, activity like the kind described above can't affect prices in even the short run. To explain why, I'll first need to explain how the exchanges match up orders to execute trades.

**The order book**

For every stock listed on major exchanges, there is a list of requests to buy a stock at a price (called bid orders) and a similar list of requests to sell (called ask orders). A typical bid order says something like ""I'm willing to buy 100 shares of company ABC at $10.00 per share"", and a typical ask order says something like ""I'm willing to sell 15 shares of ABC at $10.05 per share"". Exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ collect these orders into a list and sort them by price, so that the highest bid price and the lowest ask price sit on top of the respective sides of the order book. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask prices is called the spread.

For example, let's say that the two example orders above are the highest bid and lowest ask orders for ABC. If someone submits a market sell order of 20 shares of ABC, they will have the entire order executed at $10.00 per share. The bid price will remain at $10.00 per share, but there are now only 80 shares available at that price. If someone places a market buy order form 20 shares of ABC, they will have 15 shares executed at $10.05 and 5 shares executed at the next lowest ask price. This would widen the spread for ABC. If you place a limit buy order for 20 shares of ABC at $9.95 per share, this would go in the order book under the bid of $10.00, and you won't get your order filled until all shares listed for sale at $10.00 are sold first.

Some of the highest volume traders are called ""market makers"". They place both bid and ask orders around recently traded prices and hope to make money buy collecting the spread. They can lose money if the movement in price is bigger than the spread, so spreads are typically wider for more volatile names. High frequency traders make money by looking at the structure of the order book and the order flow and using algorithms to predict which way it will move.

**The NBBO and the SIP**

NBBO stands for National Best Bid/Offer, and refers to the highest bid price and lowest ask price across all exchanges. According to SEC rules, any broker must execute their client's buy orders at the lowest ask price and the sell orders at the highest bid price. Quotes of the NBBO and records of trade prices and volume are broadcast on SIP (Security Information Processes) feeds, which all executing brokers are listening too so that they can make informed decisions about the market.

**Why short attacks can't really work**

With this much information about the market being broadcast, the type of short attack described above is impossible. If potential short attackers executed a trade at a price lower than the national best bid, everyone listening to the SIP feed would know about it and their illegal activity would be extremely obvious. Certainly, whoever owned the bid at the top of the book would be pretty annoyed, since a worse buy order just got filled.

And even if they don't wind up getting in trouble for it, the best bid price is still sitting there waiting to be filled by a sell order. Any broker executing a retail sell order would have to execute at the best available bid price according to the NBBO rules. And any market maker or high frequency trader will see what's happening and should know to ignore it.

The only way these shorters could actually drive the price down would be to burn through the entire buy side of the order book until they reach some target price. This can move the price down, but typically it gets harder and harder the further you get into the order book. High frequency traders and day trading algorithms would also be able to catch on and start placing bids so they can buy at these artificially low prices, and the impact of the short trade will decay over time. As a result, the bears would have increased the amount of short they needed to cover without moving the price all that much, and they'll have lost some money in the process.

**So what causes market crashes like GME had on 1/29?**

For a crash like this to happen, sellers need to cross the spread to get their sells filled faster than the buy side of the book can replenish, causing the buy side of the book to thin out and vanish until it regains support at a lower level. This is basically order book speak for ""a lot more people wanted to sell than buy"". Beyond that it's hard to figure out exactly what happened, but it was probably a combination of some of the following:

* Market makers had bought enough of GME that they didn't want to risk buying more and/or got a sell signal, so they pulled or lowered their bids
* Bid side support from retail investors thinned or vanished after some brokers locked them out from buying more
* Bid side support from previous shorts like Melvin thinned or vanished as shorts finished up covering their positions
* New investors opened up short positions if they felt GME was overpriced
* Some retail traders who rode the wave up took a profit at the perceived peak
* As the price began to fall, retailers who bought on margin were forced to liquidate at market price (the exact opposite of a short squeeze)
* As the price began to fall, long investors panicked and sold
* As the price began to fall, sellers of options decreased their stake used to hedge as option delta decreased (a downward gamma squeeze)

Anyone who sold at the top of this crash probably contributed to the decline, but that doesn't make it market manipulation. If a trader of any kind looked at the order book, decided the buy side was thin, and sold, that's just a good trade.

As far as I can tell, the notion of a short ladder attack is completely made up. Not only is it technically infeasible, but [there was little to no mention of it anywhere on the web just a couple weeks ago](https://www.truthorfiction.com/what-is-a-short-ladder-attack/). I'm guessing it's just an excuse that bulls invented and parroted when prophecies of price spikes didn't come true."|investing|The Myth of the Short Ladder Attack|299.0|0.84

I'd like to explain why I believe LMND is currently overvalued, and encourage you to please poke holes in my arguments. Tell me what I'm missing please, particularly re. the path to profitability and the reinsurance topic.

**Basics**

* Lemonade says it's an insurance company that leverages AI to price risk better.
* Lemonade claims to ""disrupt"" the insurance industry by using AI, implying all others don't.
* Lemonade has a do-good attitude, borderline arrogant, to all of its marketing. This appeals to quite some folks primarily in the U.S., as their growing client numbers show.
* The company was recently discussed by a bearish outlet called ""the friendly bear"", and by Citron. The Friendly Bear article is worth a reading imo, the Citron video was absolutely weak and didn't attack the company meaningfully.
* From what I can tell, customers are either extremely happy or extremely disappointed with the company. The former are mainly - not only! - the ones that never submitted a claim and only experienced the sign-up process. My research is limited to reading reviews on the app store.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bull case**

* Lemonade's AI capability: If LMND does manage to use AI to price risk better than its competitors, this could result in lower loss ratios. However, note that AI typically needs a lot of data points; data points LMND has just started collecting. Heavy reliance on AI also reduces salary spending and should lead to low costs of adding incremental customers.
* Target demographic: Below 40 year olds, due to hipster-oriented marketing and your phone being the only distribution channel. The idea is to grow alongside those customers.
* Doing good: Parts of earnings go to the lemonade foundation and from there to charities pre-selected by policyholders.
* Founder: Founders have founded and grown firms previously (Fiverr).
* Growth potential: LMND is rapidly expanding its insurance offerings, having most recently started to offer pet insurance, life insurance.

**Bear case**

* Use of reinsurance: LMND cedes 75% of risks, and 75% of premiums received, to reinsurers. I think this is the main red flag here. Superior AI should allow them to underwrite only good risks, meaning they need less reinsurance - not more - than other insurance companies. The 25% ceding commission they gain is a small drop, it means they cede ""only"" 56% of premium, not the full 75%. Note that in addition to ceding 75%, they use even more reinsurance to manage the remaining 25% - meaning they probably retain about 20% of risk - and premium - themselves.
* Use of reinsurance 2: The S1 (July 1, 2020) announces the plan to start ceding 75% starting in Q3. So one quarter after going public, the company dramatically changes it's business model for it's core business which is providing insurance. This is suspect to say the least.
* Slight risk of misstating the truth: (Disclaimer: I can't judge as to whether this is illegal, nor do I want to enter that discussion). However, I believe that a) They might not actually pass the litmus test for being an insurance company. They are, at the moment, not more than a broker for reinsurers, that earns about 20 cents for every 1 dollar in premium.
* Political risk: The charities one can select do not resonate with less liberal folks, according to app store reviews.
* No path to profit visible: GWP in 3Q20 was 71.2, but ceded written premium was 118.6, resulting in NWP of -47.4. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased. Both is a result of the heavy reinsurance use. The gross earned premium figure in the 3Q20 can't be reconciled with prior quarters and the company presents gross earned premium of positive 42.9, but then another 32.4 are ceded to reinsurers, leading to revenue of only 17.8.
* Use of AI most likely overstated: a) The firm has no significant R&amp;D spending - ""technology development"" is an own line item (5m in Q3) but it's four times less than sales and marketing, and half that of G&amp;A. This is clearly not an indicator LMND invests massively into its AI capabilities. Rather they seek to push top line. b) If AI is so good there would be less need for reinsurance because the AI would be capable to weed out bad risks. Instead, LMND uses a shitload of reinsurance.
* Planned share issuance at 165$ - then at the all-time high, they announced the offering. A smart move that will bring in cash they need to grow (think advertising). And an indicator that mgmt thinks the stock is currently overvalued.
* Abroad growth is slow: In Germany, LMND is a very tiny (think &lt;1% of market) player according to news by competitor wefox and by other articles. In France they won some lawsuit about the use of the color pink, but I haven't yet found any data on their market share there, I assume it's negligible.
* The company's stock price started jumping once the stock was a suggested buy by motley fool. Motley fool regularly issues bullish articles on the stock. In addition, the firm seems - to me - to be actively marketing its shares through social media like tiktok. This sheds in my view a very dubious light on the firm.
* Lack of insurance experience by chief executives. While they have succeeded founding companies and taking them public in the past, they have no insurance industry experience. I see this as a major red flag in such a complex industry.

**My main issue / stuff that prevents me from going all-in on my bearish bet:**

* No obvious catalyst visible that could trigger a big drop in share price - I'm afraid that if they keep growing customers, as top line grows, so will the stock price. I'm afraid investors see this as one of the only few ""hot new stocks"" in the insurance segment, leaving little alternative to investing if one wants to be part of innovation in insurance.
* Side note: Timing-wise, one problem might arise in 3 years when they will have to renegotiate the 75% reinsurance agreements. If their AI sucks, then their risks are not above market average, and if that's the case, reinsurers might raise premium / reduce ceding commission. I see this as one potential catalyst, but it's far in the future.

**Positions currently held, albeit with medium conviction only, and planning to hold at least after Q4 release:**

* 2x LMND Feb 21 (Feb 12 expiration) 120P, currently worth 232$
* 1x LMND Jan22 (Jan 21 expiration) 100P, currently worth 2900$
* Side note: all options seem thinly traded and bid-ask is huge"|investing|Why I think Lemonade is overvalued|70.0|0.87

Athersys’ claim to fame is going to be it’s line of MAPC stem cells, MultiStem. These cells are believed to reduce inflammation after major injury, leading to better outcomes (lower death, increased quality of life) following a major event. Athersys has a strategic partnership with Healios, a pharma company in Japan, whos CEO is a beast and is really pushing the research and development along.

1. Stroke - Prior to COVID, stroke was the 5th leading cause of mortality in the US. More than 140,000 people die each year from stroke in the United States. Stroke is the leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States. Each year, approximately 795,000 people suffer a stroke.

Let’s discuss current treatments for stroke. Is it a hemorrhagic stroke? Blood pressure management and prayers. Ischemic? A crap clot busting drug, TPA, that can only be given 3 hours after initial symptoms. Did I mention it can also cause lethal bleeding? See [https://rebelem.com/ischemic-stroke-treatment-archive/](https://rebelem.com/ischemic-stroke-treatment-archive/) for full details.

Currently, Multistem is in enrolling two Phase 3 Trials for ischemic stroke, TREASURE  (sponsored by Healios) and MASTERS-2 (sponsored by Athersys) and has Fast Track Designation from the FDA. TPA, the only current treatment for acute ischemic stroke, was approved on terrible data. The bar for approval has been set SUPER LOW, giving MultiStem huge opportunity, as it can be given up to 36 hours after initial symptoms.

1. Acute Respiratory Distress SYndrome (ARDS) - remember when this was all the hype with COVID? Well there’s still no good treatment. ATHX mooned around this time and was on track to receive a boatload of funding from BARDA, as they deemed Multistem “highly relevant” for the treatment of COVID. However, the BARDA director, Rick Bright, disagreed with Trump about pushing meds without evidence, and got fired ([https://www.biocentury.com/article/304972/bright-was-fired-from-barda-for-resisting-demands-to-disregard-science-on-covid-19](https://www.biocentury.com/article/304972/bright-was-fired-from-barda-for-resisting-demands-to-disregard-science-on-covid-19)).

Currently, ATHX is conducting a Phase 3 trial (MACOVIA) for the treatment of COVID ARDS, and has Fast Track and RMAT Designation by the FDA. Healios is conducting a separate Phase 3 trial for general ARDS (ONE BRIDGE), which has potential for future pandemics and all other causes of ARDS (trauma, pancreatitis, infection).

1. Trauma (MATRICS-1) - As if stroke and ARDS aren’t enough, MultiStem is currently being studied by the Department of Defense at UTHealth for the early treatment and prevention of complications after tramatic brain injury (TBI). This study is early phase 2.

I should also note that both GrubHub and Uber report earnings this week (Feb 3, and 10th, respectively), so that should provide some insight on whether my near-term predictions hold. As of this afternoon's earnings report, Chipotle's digital orders decreased 7% from the previous quarter.

**TL/DR: DoorDash is a nonprofit organization that teaches math and financial literacy to delivery drivers.** This is a company that is overvalued by a factor of 2-6x, yet can't make money during a pandemic where people are locked in their homes and in-person restaurant visits are banned.

### Bull thesis for DoorDash:

- COVID-19 pandemic continues longer than expected, or US doesn't vaccinate 60%+ of populace by EOY 2021
- Strong revenue growth over the past 2 years. ""Contribution profit"" (non-GAAP) is slowly increasing
- Rapidly increased market share, and may continue to do so
- Subscription model, strong sales/total users compared to GrubHub (despite lower sales/transaction)
- Ghost kitchen model?
- Last-mile delivery logistics focus


### Bear thesis for DoorDash

- Doordash is vastly overpriced compared to its competition, and that competition will likely further drive down margins/take-rates and commoditize food-delivery. 
    - DoorDash has the lowest take-rate (revenues/gross order value [GOV])
    - Uber has a somewhat profitable/EBITDA positive ride-share segment, that will likely recover post-COVID. Uber also just expanded it's delivery business with the purchase of Drizzly (alcohol)
    - GrubHub has actually been profitable in previous years

|Company|Market cap|TTM GOV|TTM Revenues|Take rate|P/GOV|P/S|EPS (9mo)|Sales/User ($)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|DoorDash|58,380|19,007|2,214|11.65%|3.1|26.4|-3.34|123|
|GrubHub|6,910|7,860|1,657|21.08%|0.9|4.2|-0.96|55|
|Uber|95,490|57,905|10,631|18.36%|1.6|9.0|-3.33|136|
|UberRides (65%)|61,930|33,337|7,669|23.00%|1.9|8.1|n/a|n/a|
|UberEats (35%)|33,560|24,568|2,962|12.06%|1.4|11.3|n/a|n/a|

NB: I split up Uber market cap 65/35 to get a better idea of how to potentially value UberEats on its own

- Lack of a moat and no brand loyalty: a [large percentage of customers use multiple apps](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EG-mealdelivery-charts-December2020-competitive-analysis-1024x523.png), and there is significant [geographic competition](https://secondmeasure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/EG-mealdelivery-charts-December2020-MSA-1024x635.png) across the food-delivery companies.
- Significant future legislative/regulatory risks around employee classification
- Lock up period ends in mid March, after the first earnings release (Feb 25) – and then **113M shares, purchased at an average price of $8.73, will be available to trade on the market**. Average daily volume for DASH is 4.4M shares/day. Stock price has rapidly reached $185-200 level, but has hit 140s before.
- Increasing revenues are due to the pandemic, and will likely decrease in the future - DoorDash has not been proftable, even during COVID-19. 
    - Personal disposable income, and increased off-premise food purchases are likely the primary drivers of DASH’s revenue growth quarter/quarter
    - Lifting of COVID-related restrictions, and abatement of stimulus funds will likely bring [personal disposable income](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;nipa_table_list=58&amp;categories=survey) and [off-premise food purchases](	https://rallyforrestaurants.com/impact-COVID-19-restaurant-insights.html) back to 2019 trends 
- Long-term, these apps will likely turn into last-mile delivery/logistics companies. Yet, FDX and UPS also trade at low P/S ratios (0.86, and 1.69 respectively, with 60 and 135B market caps)

**DoorDash is priced as if it has both 100% of the market share for food delivery, and that food deliveries will not decrease once the pandemic has ended.**
As you can see in the chart below, both personal disposable income, and off-premise food and beverage purchase (""OPFP""). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic stimulus, both measures drastically increased in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, before starting to level off and decline. I suspect that we will see a decline back towards 2019 levels - if we eventually get a significant portion of the populace vaccinated and withstanding additional stimulus checks. Once we're out of this mess, everyone and their mom will be wanting to eat out at restaurants, not order food to eat the one place they've been trapped for the last year.


[Here is a chart I put together overlaying data from food-delivery companies, and economic data](https://i.imgur.com/z5H5rvm.png) that I hope illustrates this point.

Let's run some projections based on off-premise food purchases (data from [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;nipa_table_list=58&amp;categories=survey)). We will look at positive, neutral, and negative projections for DoorDash, in terms of what share of total OPFP they procure, and whether they can increase their take-rate. 'Bear case' here is a longer-term projection if things return towards 2019 levels

||Bull case|Current (Q4)|Bear case|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Off-premise food (billions)|1150|1138|1025|
|Share of OPFP (bps)|75|63 (*)|30|
|Projected Q4 orders (millions)|8625|7169|3075|
|Take rate|13%|11.7%|11%|
|Projected Q4 revenues (millions)|1121|839|338|

(*) Consensus revenue estimates by analyst's project $938M in revenue, which would be a 0.70% share of OPFP. Q3 2020 share of OPFP was 0.63% for DoorDash

If we valued DoorDash like we did its competitors, its market cap would be: (using projections from previous table)

|...if we valued DoorDash like we did (millions of $):|Bull|Current (Q4)|Bear|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
|Currently (26 P/S)|80,088|72,641|59,441|
|UberEats (12 P/S)|36,447|33,058|27,051|
|GrubHub (5 P/S)|15,186|13,774|11,271|


**I believe a strong, bull-case valuation is realistically somewhere around $29B - this puts us at $90/share**

-	Let's assume total food delivery gross sales stays at 2020 levels of $60B/year, and DoorDash captures 100% of the market. This gives us 6.6B revenue, and a 28B valuation at ~4x P/S
-	Let's assume total food delivery gross sales gradually decline (~8% q/q) over 2021, and DoorDash maintains its current market share. This provides $3.5B in revenue over 2021 (still, a significant bump over Q3 2020 TTM revenues), so even an 8x P/S valuation puts us back at 28B
-	$29B is also close to the current and bearish projections for food orders in the above table, given an UberEats-like valuation

**A more realistic, long-term valuation is probably about 50% lower - around $60/share**

Unity Software ([U](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/U?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) presents an incredible opportunity to own a cutting-edge software engine that is setup to be a large player in the digital world of tomorrow. Unity also trades at a massive valuation of \~40x estimated 2021 revenue. The following analysis compares the value of Unity's upside optionality with Unity's optimistic market cap today to see if there is still room for the stock to grow.

## What you should know

Unity sells a real-time 3D content creation system (an advanced application to build videogames) to creators which is deployable to 20 platforms (game systems) called Create Solutions, which comprises [\~30%](https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q320-Investor-Presentation-FINAL.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of revenue. Unity also sells various monetization and product optimization tools to Create users and other creators called Operate Solutions, which comprises \~60% of revenue. Unity has capitalized on the growing market demand from both individual creators and studios to create and deploy content with minimal friction or capital investment. Unity also has strategic partnerships with operating systems, consoles, and various notable firms, comprising \~10% of revenue.

Create Solutions is a sticky, subscription based model with over [1.5 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) monthly active creators. This model has extremely low churn due to the training required to use the system, but also has lower growth due to very fierce competition. Operate Solutions provides a service for the end creation, and is mostly based on usage. Thus, Operate Solutions has the ability to scale very quickly with gaming growth, and grows as game usage increases. Unity has achieved tremendous growth as the gaming market has continued to explode over the last decade, with an LTM dollar based net expansion rate (“DBNER”) of [144%](https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q320-Investor-Presentation-FINAL.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).

## Upside Opportunity

The gaming market will continue to grow throughout the 2020s, but Unity's c-suite has emphasized that its focus is on growth in the non-gaming market.

The non-gaming market for Unity today has barely been punctured, with only [8%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000119312520227862/d908875ds1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) of Unity customers spending over $100k being categorized as non-gaming customers.

Future non-gaming demand will come from the continued transformation of our lives into a more virtual world, blogs typically refer to this with the popular catch-all phrase: the “[metaverse](https://thegeneralist.substack.com/p/the-s-1-club-unity-is-manifesting?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link).” This path is paved by continued disruptive innovation in areas such as in-home technology and entertainment, transportation, retail, and the overall increase in the usage and capabilities of technology in our daily lives. This is the most exciting and risky part of the bullish thesis: the imagination and creativity associated with the non-gaming market capture add tremendous upside as well as heightened risk. As we’ll find out below: the gaming upside is mostly priced in. It is very difficult to try to value something that doesn’t really exist today and may not exist in ten years. The following approach attempts to value the optionality of the non-gaming market to corroborate the existing and more predictable cash flows from gaming-related operations.

## Valuation

Let’s say Unity’s estimated 2020 revenue of [\~$750 million](https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2020/Unity-Announces-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) grows by \~30% in 2021 to around $1 billion (within reason, \~42% growth in FY2019, estimated 40% in FY2020, in line with reasonably decaying DBNER). Unity is trading at a $40 billion market cap today, implying a 40x multiple on 2021 revenue (no outstanding debt).

## Okay, another ridiculous SaaS multiple. How do you justify that?

Let’s figure out how much Unity has to grow before a perpetual exit multiple is achieved, and then we can look at the non-gaming market.

&gt;His Pershing Square Capital Management LP recently increased its stake in Howard Hughes Corp. to nearly 25%. The Houston-based developer is ramping up construction of multifamily housing in Texas, Maryland, Hawaii and Las Vegas.

&gt;“It’s not a Wall Street bet. It’s a generational bet,” said Mr. Ackman, who is also chairman of Howard Hughes’s board. The fund manager is widely known for his shareholder-activism campaigns and his bets on large companies such as Starbucks Corp. and J.C. Penney Co.

&gt;Pershing Square increased its stake in Howard Hughes by about 4.7% between June and January, according to public filings. The firm bought common stock, and some of its counterparties exercised options that compelled Pershing Square to buy additional shares, filings show.

&gt;Howard Hughes, a land owner and developer of master-planned communities, said it is starting construction on 1,475 new apartments across four cities that have experienced an influx of people over the past year.

&gt;While many Americans were already leaving colder, more dense cities for more temperate and affordable places to live, the pandemic and the shift toward work from home accelerated those trends last year.

&gt;Howard Hughes Chief Executive David O’Reilly said his company has seen more transplants from California seeking housing in its Summerlin master-planned community in Las Vegas, next to the Red Rock National Conservation Area. Apart from a 295-unit luxury-apartment complex, the developer is also starting construction on a 10-story office tower, anticipating demand from companies looking to relocate to where people want to live.

&gt;Howard Hughes, which owns up to tens of thousands of acres in each project, sells smaller plots of land to other developers. It plans to continue building neighborhoods that mature and eventually become town centers.

&gt;Building trails in these master-planned communities have also paid off, as many people prefer to live in walkable and bikeable neighborhoods. “The trail systems are cited as the number one or two amenity,” said Mr. O’Reilly, referring to resident surveys.

&gt;Still, these large development projects are complex and require access to financing to keep going. A slowdown in the economy could hurt leasing activity once these properties are completed.

&gt;Buildout could also suffer from higher construction costs or get mired in delays. In New York City, for instance, Howard Hughes continues to face difficulties in getting approvals to move ahead on its plans to build two towers in the Seaport District in lower Manhattan.

&gt;“It proved to be a tough project. From an investor standpoint, people have already mentally written it off,” said Alexander Goldfarb, senior research analyst at Piper Sandler &amp; Co.

&gt;The share price of Howard Hughes has recovered from its March lows last year, but isn’t back to its prepandemic levels. At the start of 2020, its share price hovered around $123 and then plunged to $34 in March. It was at $88.23 in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday.

&gt;Howard Hughes Corp. began as an oil-drilling tool business started by the businessman and inventor Howard Hughes Sr. His famously eccentric son, the businessman, filmmaker and pilot Howard Hughes Jr., diversified the company into real estate.


&gt;Mr. Ackman’s Pershing Square has held a position in the stock ever since it was spun off from mall owner General Growth Properties Inc., following its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2010.

&gt;“We’ve owned it for 10 years, and it’s likely we’d still own this 10 years from now,” Mr. Ackman said.

Hormel is unique in that it offers such strong returns -- it crushes the market over any longer-term timeframe. And it manages to do so while having minimal downside risk. The company has no net debt, so its stock is immune to all short-term financial crises or liquidity shocks. Hormel is also able to (and often does) make acquisitions on good terms since it always has cash on hand and can close deals quickly without needing to raise funds.

The company's products are not at risk of technological disruption nor significant changes in consumer demand. That may seem true of all consumer staples companies, but it's actually not. Many firms have stuck to old brands that are no longer in fashion or on top of nutritional trends. Many dated product categories like cereal, soda, and crackers are in seemingly slow but irreversible long-term decline.

Hormel's management team's central mission is to avoid that fate. The company prides itself on generating 15% of its revenues from new products launched over the past five years. It invests heavily (by food company standards) in R&amp;D and is always rolling out line extensions and new formats for existing products (it's taken huge share in the emerging meat and dairy snacks category, for example, by figuring out that convenience store shoppers wanted an alternative to usual junk foods long before the rest of the market woke up to the nascent protein revolution).

The company also focuses on being agnostic -- it wants to sell you whatever protein you want. If you want almond butter and plant protein-based ""meat"", it's happy to sell that. If you want organic high-end deli meats, it is now a leader in that. It just bought a major barbeque business. And they were first to jump into turkey on a national level almost two decades ago, helping to bolster turkey's popularity as a leaner alternative to traditional offerings. Hormel anticipates what consumers will want five years from now and prepares accordingly.

Yes, Hormel is known for SPAM. Many people instinctively wince when they think about that product. But, you're probably not the target audience for it. There's a huge regional community within Asians and Latinos that like canned meat and SPAM in particular. Just as Hormel has bought specialty nut butters, organic meats, and the nation's leading guacamole to appeal to certain consumers, it's happy to sell SPAM and other products to different demographics.

As the CEO says, we are the protein company. As shareholders, it doesn't matter which proteins are more popular any given day as long as we're gaining market share. Also, for what it's worth, SPAM sales have hit [new record highs](https://www.sunset.com/food-wine/kitchen-assistant/spam-breaks-sales-records-hawaiian-cuisine?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) each of the past five years, so that's not bad for a legacy product.

Hormel focuses on having all its brands as the #1 or #2 player in its category. And it tends to divest brands which it can't get to that point. When you go to a grocery store, if you want to buy something that Hormel sells, they're generally going to have the biggest shelf space of it. In some cases, it may be the only one of that type -- how many brands of ready-to-eat guacamole, corned beef hash or chocolate hazelnut butter do you need? Particularly with the way shopping is shifting, you'd rather own 50% market share in a bunch of small categories with fat profit margins rather than being one of eight different cereal or ketchup sellers."|investing|HRL stock (Hormel Foods), sounds good|16.0|0.79

Guys,

I invested in Athabasca Oil, a Canadian energy company based on the development of thermal and light oil assets.

In Q4 of 2020, the Alberta government introduced geothermal regulations to diversify their energy sector. Part of ATH’s projects are thermal oil which has regulatory approval for 40,000 bbl/d. With Biden axing Keystone XL, geothermal is the direction that Canadian oil and gas companies are taking to diversify.

Currently, I’ve pulled in a 55% return over 3 months.

I bought in at 0.17 and it’s been going up ever since. My current analysis is that with the political climate in Canada surrounding Canada-US relations, the feds are going to push for geothermal production to ramp up in Canada, and if there’s a Canadian election in 2021, the stock is bound to shoot up.

Lumen Technologies, Inc. was founded in 1968 and is headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana. The company was formerly known as CenturyLink, Inc. and changed its name to Lumen Technologies, Inc. in September 2020.  


LUMN acquired ""Level 3"" in November 2017. Then CEO of Level 3, Jeffrey Storey became the new CEO of LUMN in June 2018. While Jeffrey was CEO at Level 3, he completely turned around that company.   


**Major risk factors?**   
High debt level and declining revenue on legacy assets.  


**Why I am long LUMN?**

LUMN owns about 450,000 miles of optic fiber and serves 60 countries. 

Since, becoming CEO in 2018, Jeffrey has drastically improved the balance sheet. LUMN refinanced \~$18 billion to $20 billion in last few years which helped to reduce the interest expense significantly and push debt maturity way in the future. They also started paying down the debt.   


Revenue on legacy business is declining but the revenue on rest of the business seems stable and started growing slowly. 

With the current free cash flow - $1/year dividend seems sustainable.

This is absurd as AMD is a major player amongst the chip-makers recently seeming to have surpassed Intel in marketshare. It's chips are used in both the PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, showing that it is a major player on both sides of the gaming community.

Robinhood has created artificial selling pressure on AMD, while AMD's short interest has increased to 5.9% Not a ton of short interest, but this number has only recently grown in correlation with the limitations put into place by Robinhood. Coincidence? I think not! Corruption? Maybe a little bit.

There are also clear indicators that AMD will continue to gain market share in the GPU/Chip industry. As recently they had to diverge some production to Samsung as Taiwan Semiconductors could not produce enough fast enough. (Source:  [https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-might-solve-gpu-stock-woes-by-outsourcing-some-production-to-samsung))

Along with these basic facts reflecting on AMD's product portfolio, something essential to do; one can see they are boasting their strongest product portfolio line in years including their new 7 Ryzen 5000 chip that is for both mobile processors and desktops. Sales of the Ryzen chip grew 18% YoY, this had assisted in amazing earnings growth.

AMD's Earnings Summary 2019 vs. 2020 showed Record revenue of 9.76 Billion up 45% from 2019. Their gross margin of 45% increased for the 5th straight year. Along with this Net Income and EPS doubled from the prior year. Finally operating cash flow was up to 1.07 billion a 117% increase YoY, and they had record free cash flow of $777 Million a 182% increase YoY. All together this makes for an extremely strong balance sheet with 2.29 Billion in cash, cash equivilants and short term investments.

The one major risk I see in AMD is that Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all want to begin to create their own in-house chips. Along with this while AMD has surpassed Intel and is competing with Nividia, it could lose market share and fall behind. This company faced bankruptcy twice once in 2000 when the tech bubble popped, and again in 2012. However, I believe that this company will continue there exponential growth and have major gains in it's stock over the course of 2021 and see $100 by the end of February.

   * **35% YoY growth in services revenue** in Q3. Possible that some of it is catchup from Q1/Q2 and/or related to USD weakness, but 35% is inline with prior years
   * Due to pandemic, fiscal 2020 (ends June) service revenue was flat and resumed on-trend in Q3. Q4 results should confirm/deny this trend
* **Increasing Services share of revenue** from 6 to 14% in 2 years
   * Recurring and high-margin (70%) stream
   * Typically related to post-warranty maintenance and training. 1 to 3 year warranty on 10-15 year design life
* **Steady growth in Install base**
   * The 26% topline growth YoY in Q3 in IA likely included significant catch-up demand from Q2 and USD weakness
   * Sustained constant-currency growth is perhaps closer to 10%
   * Reminds me of Boeing’s and Apple’s services revenue playbook, though of course nowhere near the same quality
* **Equipment replacement cycle** to embrace smart factory manufacturing techniques in China
   * In turn driving new contracts and increased service revenues, per 20-F
   * 10-15 year design life of control systems provides recurring opportunities
* **Favorable policies for Domestic suppliers**
   * Import substitution accelerating in High speed rail signalling
   * Incentives for factory modernization
* **Total solution provider** \- from equipment supply to installation to maintenance
   * Many Western firms require intermediaries to install/maintain. E.g. SAP installation by consultants
* **Entering new areas**
   * Executing a pilot project on smart highways, where highways have sensors all along them to guide traffic in extreme weather
   * Industrial Internet-of-Things is another buzz area

**Financials Appeal**

* **Take-private proposal for 17$ currently on the table**
   * Offer from a former insider
   * He upped his[ offer to 17$](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210129/A52Z922CL22232AL22232CY23PRJZ222Z632/) and revealed a 7% position after management rejected his prior offer at 15.5$
   * I expect management to reject this offer too
   * More than anything, this offer eliminates the need to discount for unknowns
* **Strong balance sheet**:
   * The stock is a net-net stock - it’s net current assets is greater than all liabilities
   * Setups like this are extremely rare in my experience for solid companies and provide a huge margin of safety
* **Compelling Valuation**
   * **Revenue**
      * Honeywell: 2019/TTM: 36/33 $B
      * HollySys IA: 2019/TTM: 259/255 $M
      * HollySys IA + Rail: 2019/TTM: 475/438 $M (flat in IA and down in Rail)
   * **Revenue growth pre-pandemic**
      * Honeywell: 5% in 2017/18. 18/19 numbers affected by divestment
      * HollySys IA: 20% 2019 over 2018.
      * HollySys IA: 7% TTM YOY ending Q3 2020 (3 Quarters of pandemic)
   * **Current Price/TTM FCF multiple**
      * Honeywell: 33
      * HollySys: 8
      * We don’t have per-segment FCF, but IA and HSR are similar margins with similar revenue numbers
      * FCF calculated net of Working Capital impacts
   * **Current Price/2019 FCF multiple**
      * Honeywell: 23
      * HollySys: 6  (fiscal 2019)
      * FCF calculated net of Working Capital impacts
   * **Market Cap**
      * Honeywell: 140 B$
      * HollySys: 840 M$
   * **Worth 56$ using Honeywell’s Price/FCF multiples**
      * Just the IA segment should be worth north of 30$
* **Potential buyback**: Management indicated stock buyback and/or acquisitions once they feel comfortable the pandemic is behind
* **Near-term catalysts**: Q1 earnings report in mid-Feb should provider more clarity on the underlying trend

**Key Risks**

* The numbers look better than they are because USD lost 10% against Yuan last year
   * With unprecedented USD printing, foreign exposure in the portfolio is reasonable
* Revenue growth in Industrial Automation stays below 10%
   * In mitigation, Honeywell had a peak 2017/18 revenue growth of 5% and has a 30 P/E. IA markets tend to be very sticky after all
* Something is wrong with the accounting (it’s a Chinese company)
   * Insider take-private bid at 17$ along with a 7% stealth stake suggests the assets are good quality rather than something nefarious going on.
   * 20 year track record argues against it too
* Management sells out for the 17$ offer currently on the table
   * I don’t see this as likely as they are aware of the equity’s underpricing

**Bottomline**: Solid 20 year track record with reasonable growth prospects as Chinese factories become ""smart"" with other irons in the fire. At Honeywell’s Price/FCF multiples, it is worth close to 50$. A former insider’s 7% stake and a persistent, second increased bid at 17$ to acquire the company speaks to recognition of its under-valuation. Trading volumes of 250K shares/day suggest an under-followed company rather than any fundamental reason to trade as a net-net stock.

Cheers.

**Edit #1**: Corrected insider's stake from 14% as originally mentioned to 7%. I misread the [disclosure](http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210129/A52Z922CL22232AL22232CY23PRJZ222Z632/) as 6.9% of Ace Lead's stake controlled by Shao + 7.1% owned by Shao = 14%, but the 7.1% includes Ace Lead's stake.

These ""non-governmental regulators"" have immense discretionary power over the market. In Robinhood's case, their clearinghouse called ""The DTCC"" raised Robinhood's capital deposit requirements by 10x in middle of the rally to cover the volatility of their users trades. This forced Robinhood into a liquidity crisis and caused them to restrict trades in highly desired names.

Today, the Robinhood CEO put out a blog post calling for real-time settlement, which would eliminate the need for these capital deposits and open up the industry to new entrants. We have the technology!

[Text](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement)

&gt;It’s time for T+2 to go.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week we saw the impact the two-day trade settlement period has on investors and ultimately the entire American financial system. Clearinghouse deposit requirements skyrocketed overnight. People were unable to buy some of the securities they wanted. Investors were angry and concerned, an unintended byproduct of the antiquated settlement process.  
&gt;  
&gt;When people invest, they’re placing their hopes and dreams for the future in our financial system. We can’t let them down.  
&gt;  
&gt;The existing two-day period to settle trades exposes investors and the industry to unnecessary risk and is ripe for change. Every day, clearing brokers like Robinhood Securities have to meet deposit requirements imposed by clearinghouses to support customer trades between the trade date and the date the trades settle. Investors are left waiting for their trades to clear, and the clearing brokers have their proprietary cash locked up, until the settlement is final days after the trade.  The clearinghouse deposit requirements are designed to mitigate risk, but last week’s wild market activity showed that these requirements, coupled with an unnecessarily long settlement cycle, can have unintended consequences that introduce new risks.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time. Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s been four years since the securities industry moved from a three-day to a two-day settlement period. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation, as well as other stakeholders, have recognized the benefits of an even shorter timeframe, leveraging technology. Meanwhile, millions of new investors have entered the market for the first time as technology transforms the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s time for the financial system to catch up.  
&gt;  
&gt;The last few weeks have been extraordinary. We’ve seen a social movement intersect with technology and financial markets, and retail investors take the lead. These are our neighbors and friends and many from our Robinhood community.  
&gt;  
&gt;As industry leaders, we need to meet this moment with a vision for the future and a focus on the people we serve. The industry, Congress, regulators, and other stakeholders need to come together to deploy our intellectual capital and engineering resources to move to real-time settlement of U.S. equities. Accomplishing this won’t be without its well-documented challenges, but it is the right thing to do and Robinhood is eager to drive this critical effort on behalf of all investors.   Technology is the answer, not the oft-cited impediment. We believe it is important for all relevant stakeholders to convene in the near term to discuss the urgency and necessity of this issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;To protect innovation, to steward our industry into the future, and most of all to meet customer demand. We want to join together to move forward to real-time settlement."|investing|Robinhood: It's time for real-time settlement|3.0|0.64

My experience is limited but I have a basic college level economics class under my belt so I went into this flurry with an understanding of what stocks are and how investment works, and I’ve done some deep dives into how short selling and options trading works recently (for obvious reasons).

How much weight do you give to an industry's overall performance? I'm probably not using the right terms here, so I will clarify some more: I’m specifically looking at the gaming market. Back in 2016 I was part of a (failed) startup in the Esports industry, and while I don’t have a background in business, our business major on the team researched market statistics so that we could present an accurate growth model to investors. One stat that they mentioned was YoY Growth, and from my understanding the gaming market at the time had an insane YoY. In 2016 the gaming market in the United States was predicted to grow to a value of 90 Billion, and to my current understanding it is at around 150 Billion today and projected to grow to 200 Billion by the end of 2021. So my question is this, does this statistic matter to investors when you look at companies in the industry? 

It seemed to be important to the angel investors we pitched to, but I don’t know if it is relevant to the stock market and IPOs. 

Another thing which I learned by being a part of that startup was that the typical wealthy investor is ancient. We gained some traction early on but once we got to the “top floor” so to speak we were pitching to a room of what may as well have been mummified corpses. After all our market research and pretty crayon graphs we reached the point where you answer questions and one of the first questions was: “So, your saying that people will pay to watch other people play video games?”. 

That was a pretty heavy blow, how would we explain the entire concept of Esports to these guys who hadn’t even heard of Twitch? Needless to say we did not receive investment that day. This lead me to believe that there is a serious lack of understanding of the gaming market among older (and richer) investors. Accordingly, I believe this is why we see younger Billionaires supporting Gamestop while hedge fund managers are in the news describing it as “the next Blockbuster”. Is there some credence to my belief that such a market thesis is wrong, and would any retailer that exists in an industry with such high growth be a good investment if you believed in their core business model?

TL:DR: Is Year over year growth of an industry as a whole important to you when looking at a specific company in that industry? 

Is it realistic to think a retailer in a high growth industry is going to go under without making serious mistakes?

Thanks for any input it would be much appreciated at this point in time. I'm having a hard time understanding the market thesis being touted on the news about ""GME is Blockbuster 2.0""."|investing|A few questions for experienced investors about market statistics such as YoY Growth and Total Market Value.|0.0|0.4

It is expected that the existing home transactions market will gain more importance and grow with a CAGR of 12.4%.

**Risk factors (highlights)**

·  The business is susceptible to fluctuations in China's residential real estate market and is subject to government regulations.

·  If they fail to maintain relationships with real estate developers or attract them to engage them, or otherwise fail to procure new real estate property listings at favorable terms, the business and growth prospects may suffer.

·  If they fail to obtain or keep licenses, permits or approvals applicable to the various services provided by them, they may incur significant financial penalties and other government sanctions.

·  Competition from other industry players. They may lose market share and customers if they fail to compete effectively. Their greatest competitor is E-House. Alibaba has a large stake (&gt;10%) in E-House.

Many people (in this subreddit and others) are of the thought that short selling is manipulative and a dirty practice used by hedge funds to profit off of sound investments.

This is why I wanted to share [this 12 year old video from khanacademy](https://youtu.be/zAkMhEqWFF0) that attempts to show the benefits from short selling.

Very important to note that this video was made at the height of the financial crisis and near the bottom of the stock market crash, so Sal has almost every reason to be critical of those who try to profit off of lies and deceit. Yet Sal does bring up many great points and does caution that short sellers who do actually manipulate the markets are bad, yet they are integral to an efficient and transparent market.

I wanted to start a discussion on this and get some other peoples views on investment opportunities. Supposedly, a decision is expected to come out soon.

All said and done, I'm currently down about 7k on this stock. I probably should just cut my losses but I feel like if the big boys have some tricks up their sleeves maybe so do some of you.

In the long term I was thinking about potentially averaging down my cost per share to try and sell at a break even if possible. This would obviously expose me to even more risk BUT... for example, say the price were to drop to around 20 dollars per share if I bought 500 shares this would bring my average cost to about $38.6. However, I've never done something like this so I'm not entirely sure how the math would work out in the end.

Obviously we don't know how to future of Gamestop will pan out, maybe it's worth around $100 in a few years like Chewy or it goes the route of KB toys and ceases to exist.

Following the completion of the transaction, Drizly’s marketplace will be integrated with the Uber Eats app. The company will keep the standalone Drizly app as well, it said.

Founded in 2012, Drizly has become the leading on-demand alcohol delivery service in the U.S. and is available in 1,400 cities. The purchase could help drive people to use Uber’s app more often.

Uber Eats has been a key segment to Uber’s business amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has dramatically reduced the number of people leaving their homes.

“During this time our delivery business as been growing at extraordinary rates,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC on Tuesday. Drizly said it had more than 300% growth in the past year.

The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2021. Uber said that it anticipates that more than 90% of the consideration to be paid to Drizly shareholders will consist of shares of Uber common stock, and the balance will be paid in cash.

Uber stock was up more than 7% in the morning.

Uber has focused its acquisition efforts on its Eats segment during the coronavirus pandemic. After talks failed to acquire food delivery service GrubHub, Uber acquired Postmates last July.

At the same time, Uber has offloaded some of its more cost-eating transportation segments. The company last May transferred its electric bike and scooter business, Jump, to Lime. Uber also sold its self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group, to its start-up competitor Aurora Innovation on December 7, valuing ATG at approximately $4 billion at the time. Just a day later, it announced it was selling its flying taxi business, called Uber Elevate.

**Linking everything together**

* Reddit last valued privately at 3B.
* Generally SPACs can do a merger with a company up to 10x the capital pool.
* VYGG raised 575M. This would likely give Reddit an IPO valuation of 6-8B.
* Alexander Tamas (AT) is an expert on social media/internet businesses.
* AT previously invested in FB, Twitter, Reddit, and Mail.ru. His VC fund, Vy Capital, owns some percentage of Reddit. Specific ownership stats not disclosed.
* Steve Huffman, Reddits Co-founder and CEO, is on the Vy Global Growth Board of Directors. He is not affiliated with any other SPAC.
* The VYGG prospectus specifically allows the Sponsors including Vy Capital to “self-deal” which allows them to bring one of the companies they have previously invested in public.
* AT has over 140M of his own dollars invested in VYGG common shares. This incentivizes him to only partner with a strong business that can truly grow over an extended period of time.
* Reddit is a founder-led social media technology company with 52M daily active users and 440M monthly active users. Exactly the kind of business laid out in the VYGG prospectus.
* If Reddit can successfully monetize that audience it could be worth hundreds of Billions someday.
* Steve Huffman’s goal is to offer every person an opportunity to join communities that they align with. He dislikes instagram/facebook and wants to enable people to interact with each other “authentically”.
* Reddit has recently posted job openings for roles to lead an IPO of the company.
* This means Reddit is ready to go public and now, because of VYGG, has an easy and fast way to get into the public market.
* It usually takes between 30 and 90 days from the SPACs letter of intent to the actual merger date, so this could happen over the next six months.

**What happens if I’m right and Reddit merges with VYGG?**

* Companies with similar user statistics have valuations in the tens of billions. Twitter - 41B, Pinterest - 43B, Snapchat - 83B.
* If reddit goes public for 6-8B then shareholders of VYGG could see a rapid revaluation up to 30-80B. That is between a 3 and 13x.
* Reddit has multiple communities of stock and options traders. Most notably [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) (WSB) which has grown from 1.8M members at the start of January 2021 to 8M today.
* WSB has a mentality of doing crazy YOLOs using OTM call options. Recently some in the community have been taking out student loans, leveraging them, and putting the cash into weekly expiry 100%+ OTM call options on companies.
* I am bringing this up not because it's a good approach too investing, but to illustrate the mentality that goes along with these trading communities. Those 8M members represent billions of investable dollars that could be used to bid-up the price of their favorite social media platform, Reddit.
* This means there will likely be a “mania” if/when Reddit goes public.

**How each Member of the BOD fits into helping Reddit Grow**

**Investment Case**

1. Worst case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They fail to find a decent business combination and the cash in the trust is returned to the shareholders. Currently it is expected that around $9.2 of cash is in the trust per common share so at my $10.20 cost basis I lose a dollar per share.
2. Medium case: I’m wrong and VYGG doesn’t merge with Reddit. They find a different business combination and the common shares trade up to between $12 and $20 per share where I sell pocketing a 17-90% return in under two years.
3. Best case: I’m right and VYGG merges with Reddit. The market is still very expensive due to mass hysteria and low interest rates. VYGG/Reddit becomes a meme stock and millions of Reddit users buy in significantly punching up its price. Reddit combines the hype-ability of being a technology and social media business and the stock goes parabolic. In this scenario the price range will be dependent on the original IPO price. If it IPOs at 6-8B I could see VYGG shareholders making multiples of their original investment in a *very* short period of time (less than two-three months).

Disclosure: I hold no position in VYGG or VYGG/WS.

I'm getting confused!). I've been long the stock. It's been a pretty flat stock in my portfolio and it shouldn't be 7% of my portfolio, but hey still learning here.

I am having a hard time understanding this 8% drop today. With earnings coming this Thursday, and all ""reports"" pointing to a solid earnings report. Does this drop mean that some who ""actually knows"" what will be reported are starting to cover their positions? 

I guess I'm asking the following: Do drops in stock prices, right before earnings reports, point to the likelihood of bad news?

And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?

It is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!
When the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…

”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”

Certainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. 
But then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.

Below I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.


Refund from KGR

That we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!

https://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf 

https://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 

https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  

Why doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! 

I think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?






Increase in Company Gross 2P Reserves

We should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field. I can't make up the math here. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5222/corporate_presentation_-_dec_2020.pdfPage 2 108.5 million barrels 2P/C It produces today according to page 4. An average of 46,300 barrels per day with an ambition to raise these significantly. To 80 000-100 000 a day!108 500 000 / 46300 = 2344 / 365 = 6.5 So in about 6.5 years, you're out of oil? No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? 

How much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...



KRG and Baghdad
Will we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan? Does some of the risk disappear? And the companies get a completely different valuation?

Sarsang and Total

Very exciting things are happening in the neighboring block, Sarsang, where Total is possibly on its way to sell its share of 18%. According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. 

www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   


Plan for expansion

It will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. 

Page 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf 

Here I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! 





”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility""

I think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. 

Page 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf 

So it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?

”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” 

Is it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.


Conditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.
www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file
And for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm. Here I think the market will change attitudes towards oil stocks overall in line with a higher oil price.

First of all, There has been a shortage of ammunition for quite a while now (half a year or more) so this is not something new. There are several company out there and most if not all of their online ammunitions are all out of stock as seen in the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/ammo-inc-signature-ammunition/))

I will be focused on **Ammo Inc ($POWW)** and will provide the positives and negatives of the company and others (I will update these also based on questions and input from others).

# POSITIVE Thoughts

1. Positive note on the upcoming earnings, expecting a 272% growth year over year.
2. Increase in demand and popularity of its one of a kind specialty ammunition (STREAK Visual Ammunition) catered to military and law enforcement.
3. Increase in not just domestic contract but foreign contract.
4. One of the only company that owns a brass casing division where they can sell brass ammunition components for additional revenue.
5. Constructing new plants which is always a good sign of demand and growth
6. Increase in gun ownership grew more than 5 million in 2020.

# NEGATIVE Thoughts

* Democratic government means gun control, they will try to pass regulation to tax gun/ammunition
* High demand, ammo companies not being able to keep up with the order. Strictly bound by lack of components (primer, brass, etc...) from third party.
* Gain might already be priced in.

More details on the Positive thoughts below:

# 1. Positive note on the upcoming earnings

The company expects to achieve revenues of $55.0 million during fiscal 2021. Revenue in fiscal 2020 was $20.2 million which would represent 272% growth year over year. :

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129167/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Updates-Guidance-for-Fiscal-Year-2021-to-55-million-Reflecting-Projected-272-Year-Over-Year-Revenue-Growth.html))

AMMO anticipates reporting in excess of $16.5 million in revenue for the third quarter of the Company’s 2021 fiscal year during the February 16th earnings conference call. Approximately 500% Year-Over-Year Revenue Increase.

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/26/ammo-inc-schedules-february-16-2021-earnings-conference-call-expects-to-report-third-quarter-fiscal-results-in-excess-of-16-5-million/))

# 2. Specialty ammunition

Their STREAK Visual Ammunition, tracer rounds *allow the military and police the ability to view their rounds' flight path* which can help you more easily spot impacts as well as missed shots, is increased in demand and popularity among the military and law enforcement. Additionally, STREAK ammunitions are non-incendiary and do not generate heat, so they're safe to use in places where many tracers have been prohibited.

There's more to it but you can read and do research from the link below:

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/streak-ammunition/))

Basically, these patented ammunition from Ammo Inc gives them a competitive edge against the conservative companies.

# 3. Foreign contracts

One of the few companies that contracts ammunitions overseas, many of which are foreign law enforcement agencies, and has been doing so consistently year over year as shown below:

([https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/](https://ammoinc.com/2021/01/14/ammo-inc-enters-into-a-significant-import-export-transaction-for-7-62mm-ammunition/))

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/24/2052728/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Receives-Six-Figure-Purchase-Order-from-European-Law-Enforcement-Agency.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/24/2052728/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Receives-Six-Figure-Purchase-Order-from-European-Law-Enforcement-Agency.html))

# 4. Owns a Brass Casing Division (JMC)

Jagemann Munition Company (JMC), formerly known as Jagemann Stamping Company, is the brass casing division of Ammo Inc. They targeted the brass casing division in 2018 and closed the transaction in early 2019 for $27 million, rebranding the operations as Jagemann Munition Components (JMC). It has a reputation dating decades as being the best in class brass supplier to the ammunition and munitions industry.

([https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/](https://ammoinc.com/product-category/product-family/jmc-brass-product-family/))

# 5. Constructing new plant

The facility will support the Company’s plan to exponentially expand its manufacturing base of operations in the US and the increase of demand from over seas.

([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153664/0/en/AMMO-Inc-Announces-Plans-to-Construct-a-12-Million-Plant-Tripling-its-Manufacturing-Footprint-in-Wisconsin.html))

# 6. Increase in gun ownership

First time gun owner grew 5 million in 2020. Does not mean a continuous demand of ammunition but definitely is a plus for the industry:

([https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:\~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/#:~:text=NEWTOWN%2C%20Conn.-,%E2%80%93%20NSSF%C2%AE%2C%20the%20trade%20association%20for%20the%20firearm%20industry%2C,very%20first%20time%20in%202020).)

2/9/21 Update:
I let go all my position @ $7.10 on 2/8 expecting to buy back if it trends down a little  (what I'm expecting but if not I'll still leave happy with gain).

But now I’m confused because DD fell off a cliff monday. IFF is up nearly 20% since. What happened? Could i have sold DD friday and bought monday without consequence?

Corsair manufactures and sells parts for computers, especially gaming computers, as well as the peripherals used in streaming and gaming. Covid has understandably provided a large uptick in sales and we are coming up on Q4 earnings in 8 days, which will include holiday sales. The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.

What you need to know:

\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)

\- Earning's release for Q4: Feb 9th.

\- Announced release of new product (solid state drives) on Jan 28th

\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:

Net revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.

* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.
* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.

\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech

\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings surprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)

\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.

Christmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.

A number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.

Analyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.

TLDR: buy CRSR.

Earnings date: February 9th.

All time high: $52.37

Current: $38.13

Edit: For people asking about the dip a few weeks ago and for those concerned about the announcement of non-diluted share offering at $35, here is my two cents: There are a lot of reasons for a company to issue shares: to raise money, to decrease volatility, to enrich themselves. That Corsair's execs have decided to sell some of their own shares at $35, is in my mind, a better alternative as it will not necessarily dilute the value of existing stock and it puts it out 'on the market', even if these institutional investors are unlikely to trade these often. This sale could mean the execs think it's not going to $50, but its just as likely they see $35 as a good price, attractive to both them and institutional investors, and they want to both take some money off the table , while simultaneously decreasing the volatility of the stock. The fact that the stock was $38 when they announced this, and that most investors bought in at $12 when CRSR IPO'd 6 months ago, is actually fairly bullish, to my mind. It basically indicates that institutional investors think CRSR is worth more than twice what they paid for it. My 2 cents.

If it’s good information and truth you seek, the prudent thing to do is to do your research with all available avenues, and that means watching CNBC, and going on WSB. Maybe at the same time.**

---

I’m often asked where I get my investing ideas or “where I go for financial information” and I’ve always found that a difficult question to answer. That is because I have an (unhealthy) obsession with endlessly procuring information on a subject/company (provided it’s sufficiently interesting) but in doing so I’ve formed a long, yet reliable list of sources that I regularly use. After my voracious consumption of financial news over the last two weeks (I can’t be the only one!), I’ve decided to put pen to paper, my thoughts around the veracity and pervasiveness of information on the internet. 

There exists today a spectrum of information sources that can be loosely categorized into one of three categories: Media, Social Media, and Personal Resources. Conventional teaching states that information exists on a spectrum of quality, and while that may have been true for the last two centuries, the democratization of data has not only brought upon the **democratization of access, but also the democratization of quality**. You can find objectively good research on forums like /r/wsb and at the same time be grossly misinformed by what you hear on mainstream media channels. Below is my breakdown of all the different types of information on the internet, sorted by reach for the respective medium.

---

**Traditional Media (the greatest reach)**

* *Mainstream Media; (CNBC, WSJ, Bloomberg)* Mainstream media in its purest form is highly regulated, well vetted (for the most part) information that is disseminated through the crafting of “stories” that are meant to be consumed and not debated. Perspectives are often stated as facts, occasionally with devastating consequences, but this form of media remains the most universal and pervasive source of information even during the age of the internet.

* *Mass Media; (Yahoo Finance, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha)*; Tier 2 publications, one dimensional in nature but nonetheless with significant reach, are a step above in terms of sophistication, often with longer form analysis neatly packaged and easily proliferated. Quality of information varies significantly more than mainstream media but here is where more nuanced, detailed (public) opinions can be found.

* *Niche (but public) publications; (Short seller reports, Stock picking services, smaller financial news publications)* While definitely enjoying smaller reach than the largest communities and social media influencers, more niche resources found online still have value—granted you due your due diligence on the resource itself.

**Social Media (Medium amount of reach)**

* *Influencers (not going to name specific people, but you know the type)*; Influencers today carry a great deal of power, and it’s been proven time and time again they have the ability to move entire markets, sometimes well over an extended period of time. We’ve blown past the point of talking heads to the point where some figures are revered—often with good reason. Via social media, we are given access to some of the greatest thinkers of the modern era, considering their perspectives is absolutely something a prudent investor should do. Nonetheless, it’s important to identify these people as **people**, and **people** have biases, agendas, and underlying interests you will never learn about from a Twitter post.

* *Public Forums; (Reddit, YouTube, Twitter)* Sourcing information from communities is inherently a tricky concept, as the very nature of public forum invites discourse…for better or for worse. There is a significant upgrade to the quality of information the moment active discussion is facilitated, as ideas can immediately be challenged and debated over. Unfortunately, due to the (often) anonymous nature of discussion, the veracity of the source can vary wildly.

* *Niche communities; (Small YouTube channels, small subreddits, some podcasts)*; If you are patient enough to sift through some of the trash on the internet, here lies some of the best sources of information available. The sizes of these communities make them vulnerable to manipulation and misinformation, but the evergreen nature of these communities mean that plenty of high-quality information is put forth without any underlying agenda.

* *“Deep niche” communities*; This is wallstreetbets pre 2020, and like the internet as a whole, some of the best sources of information are often from the most degenerate. There is some incredible analysis that takes place in the dark recesses of the internet, that not only takes a lot of effort to dig for, but invested time spent distinguishing between gold and utter trash. Perhaps the most rife with discourse and discussion, these types of communities are less “communities” and more a jumbled mess of memes, trolling, and ridiculously high quality information.

**Personal Resources (little to no external reach)**

The point of this post is not just to dump a list of places you should begin to search for information, but to also push forward the idea that the traditional model of information quality (good information skews towards mainstream media) is no longer true. We’ve seen an almost identical increase in quality of information to match the increase in access, and this means to craft a well researched investment thesis (or to acquire an informed opinion on a particular topic), **to do proper due diligence, we have to explore all avenues of information** —from the front page of CNBC to the darker recesses of the internet. It’s a daunting task, but a small price to pay in pursuit of the *truth* which so often evades us in the current age where velocity trumps veracity."|investing|The quality of information on the internet and where to go when seeking the “truth”. - Learnings gathered over the last two weeks of research.|31.0|0.81

EDIT: To be clear, I'm genuinely trying to understand why they aren't currently more discussed, because they seem to have a lot to offer (solid growth potential, great dividends. If you accumulate the dividends, should have great potential for growth)

I cannot tell if investors are deliberately avoiding them for 'reasons', or, if people just feel the stock market offers far more

The downsides I am aware of include potential high volatility (if that bothers you), potential liquidity issues because the underlying assets are illiquid (though this may be less of a risk on traded ETFs), I also notice some of the funds I looked at are a mish-mash of equity and actual property holdings (so you may want to buy into the property market but actually just end up buying more stocks).

If it is not good, then this could bring another down leg.

Another down leg would mean the resurgence upward happening this morning Tues turns into another down draft.  That would mean the last market peak last week is not surpassed and a lower peak forms.  This is called a positive non confirmation.  It would seem no big deal, but the machines react to it by selling.

Having another stimulus is not guaranteed, and the last stim is already in the markets.

Businesses are still closing even though the pandemic is in essence peaked out.  Recessions begin looking like one thing and end looking like another.  The beginning of this recession is obvious - COVID 19 lock down induced.  The latter part of the recession would include foreclosures and evictions being allowed to happen, plus people becoming addicted to unemployment.

I don't always post downer stuff.  I am a long term bull like everyone, but long term is the sum of all short terms - so watch out for this week's Thursday and Friday IMHO.

EDIT - looks like I took my eye off the stimulus ball.  The Dems are using some special process rules to push the $1.9 Tril through.  The markets focused on that, making me wrong.

1612262721.0|0.0|t3_laswse|19.0|"Disclosure: I bought some shares in BAND a couple of weeks ago by selling half my stake in TWLO.

[BAND](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/BAND) is in the Communication Platform as a Service industry. It is a close competitor to [TWLO](https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/TWLO), so much so that BAND has a [page on their site](https://www.bandwidth.com/twilio-alternative/) about why they are “The smarter Twilio alternative”. Unlike TWLO, which acts as a middle-man by using other companies networks, BAND owns its own network. They say owning the network results in savings that they pass onto the customer, but BAND's gross margin is currently a bit below TWLO's (46.29% vs 51.54%). Perhaps in the long run, BAND's margins will be able to increase as they gain the benefits of scale.

I’m hoping the BAND will be able to produce similar returns that TWLO has in recent years because it’s:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Starting to grow quickly
2. At a good value now
3. In a growing market

&amp;#x200B;

1. Starting to grow quickly

Over the past four quarters, BAND’s revenue growth has accelerated from 18.46% to 40.12%. This trend looks like it should continue at least into the next quarter as the [company is expecting](https://investors.bandwidth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bandwidth-announces-third-quarter-2020-financial-results) total revenue between $96.5-97.0M (\~56% growth). Its Selling/General/Admin and R&amp;D expenses are still growing, but now at a lower rate than its revenue growth. This has helped the company to become operationally profitable, but not yet consistently bottom-line (net income) profitable.

Its Net Retention Rate is also increasing. Up from 116% a year ago to 131%. This is still behind TWLO, which is [at 137%](https://s21.q4cdn.com/963721274/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3'20-Earnings-Presentation_FINAL.pdf), but a strong figure nonetheless.

&amp;#x200B;

2. At a good value now

BAND Price-to-Gross Profit Growth Ratio (similar to PEG ratio) is at 0.94. This is a bit above the median value for its industry, but well below TWLO at 1.41 (check out the [distribution feature](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare) for this data). I think this is fine since BAND’s growth is one of the best in its industry and this growth is accelerating.

I’m using Gross Profit as my main comparison metric for a few reasons. I like that it takes into account the gross margin of the company. BAND has a lower gross margin than TWLO, so it should be penalised for this in the comparison. Using net income doesn’t make much sense since BAND is just missing out on making a profit, so its PE ratio is nonsensically low. The market caps in the software-infrastructure industry are correlated well with gross profit, so as gross profit increases, the market cap should increase in a similar step.

&amp;#x200B;

3. In a growing market

As seen by both BAND’s and TWLO’s revenue growth, there’s plenty of room to grow in this market. TWLO’s management expects its total addressable market will reach [$87B by 2023](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/twilios-secret-growth-advantage%3A-its-own-customers-2020-11-26). Currently, their combined trailing-twelve-month revenue is $1.83B (TWLO: $1.54B; BAND: $292M). TWLO’s market cap is $52B vs $4B for BAND, so there’s plenty of room for it to play catch up.

TWLO offers a wider set of services than BAND, but I see this as more opportunities for the company. If it can continue to offer a lower price and higher quality than TWLO, as it claims it can, then it should be able to remain a strong competitor.

The reason for keeping half my shares in TWLO was largely a diversification play. BAND looks like good value now and is growing well. TWLO has a long history of growth and a wide product range. Given the size of the market, there’s plenty of room for them both. Since I’m not fully confident that one will outperform the other, I thought it best to own both.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

Before I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:

I wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.

People have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.

Alright, so, today's action.

I have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.

In my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.

I tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.

One thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.

There was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.

I got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).

# The Game (Theory)

Ok, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?

Possibly.

I say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.

Ok, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?

In simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.

# Power

For most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.

Today, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.

Being in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.

If you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.

I don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.

# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk

Many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.

Some people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.

Others trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.

Others are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.

I think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.

# Swimming In The Deep

So, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.

One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.

Another question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.

All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.

If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.

Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.

If the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.

If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!

Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.

While researching, I noticed a notable prospect in General Motors and their announcement to switch from combustion engine vehicles to all-electric vehicles by 2035.

Given the size and scale of General Motors and their prominent (yet diminishing) presence in the American and foreign auto-industries, I believe there is great potential for stock growth. Some analysts have upgraded the stock price target from $50-ish to $80, among other excitable business prospects in the company and their multiple subsidiaries. Given that GM sold *roughly* 2 million cars in the United States (2019-2020) and 7 million vehicles worldwide (2019), I see great potential for a transition to the mass-scale production of electric vehicles.

General Motors has experimented with electric vehicles in the past (late 1990's-early 2000's), resulting in innovative technological successes without much consumer interest. At the moment, the fault in the company is the technological catchup General Motors will need to complete to ""even the playing field"" with established electric vehicle (EV) companies such as Tesla, although they are not alone. Looking at the business with a bullish outlook, I believe they can make the ""leap"" and leave other auto companies in the dust due to their large scale and semi-favorability among the American and Chinese auto-market. Compared to other combustion and electric car manufacturers in the United States, GM seems to have kept a market sales lead despite various consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Posting this to get feedback and start a discussion from other investors and/or users interested in the company and accompanying industries. Let me know what you guys think of the company and its future potential. Is this a solid bullish stance? Or do you see evidence suggesting otherwise?

Lets say I think that stock ABC is going to drop significantly in the next 2 months. I would like to use options to profit off of that, but I don't want to short because I'm not comfortable with unlimited downside in case I'm wrong.  I also do NOT own any ABC stock.

My understanding is I can do the following:

1. Buy a ""put option"" as ""buy to open"". This gives me the right, but not the obligation, to sell ABC stock at the strike price by the given date. For this privilege, I pay a premium upfront. 
2. I would not want to ""buy to close"" as this would be ""shorting"" and leave me on the hook to cover the position (though without paying a premium).
3. Since I don't have stock in ABC I could *not* exercise the contract even if it were ""in the money"" (profitable), but I CAN sell it to someone who has stock in ABC who would want to exercise to offset their losses. 

Questions:

1. Are the above all fully correct? I really don't want to accidentally buy the wrong thing and be on the hook.
2. If that's all right, how does part 3 work? I don't see in my Ameritrade window a place to buy and sell existing options on an options market. It seems like the options tab exclusively deals with creating new contracts (options) not buying or selling someone elses.

Aphria and Tilray Combine to Create Largest Global Cannabis Company With Pro Forma Revenue of C$874 Million 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005519/en/

&gt;Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, while holders of Tilray shares will continue to hold their Tilray shares with no adjustment to their holdings. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Aphria Shareholders will own approximately 62 percent of the outstanding Tilray Shares on a fully diluted basis, resulting in a reverse acquisition of Tilray, representing a premium of 23 percent based on the share price at market close on December 15, 2020 to Tilray shareholders. On a pro forma basis for the last twelve months reported by each company, the Combined Company would have had revenue of C$874 million (US$685 million).

The cannabis industry as a whole has extreme growth potential. I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l8ogt7/the_green_rush_weedstocks_us_legalization/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) illustrating my views on US Legalization &amp; the opportunity with long term plays. We have entered the ~~roaring~~ rolling 20’s, where cannabis regulations will ease dramatically.

While the media picks up on US Legalization, Aphria &amp; Tilray are slowly taking over Europe. 

On January 27th, 2021 the CFO of Aphria, Carl Merton did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCannalysts/comments/l2wxoa/aphria_inc_ama_january_27_2021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) in which he highlights the challenges Aphria/Tilray face to create desired synergies.

&gt;More importantly and something I think too many people fail to completely comprehend; we bring a distribution system to Tilray in Europe. Currently, Tilray pays a third party to distribute their product in Europe. That means they are only recording the sale of cannabis from the producer to the distributor and are incurring a cost to do it. By running the Tilray sale through CC Pharma, not only do we remove the distribution expense from Tilray’s operations, but the combined entity will now record the sale from the distributor to the pharmacy, effectively moving up market in our share of wallet with the consumer.

**What is CC Pharma?**

CC Pharma is a leading German Pharmaceutical and Medical Cannabis Distributor that was [acquired](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aphria-completes-acquisition-of-cc-pharma-leading-german-pharmaceutical-and-medical-cannabis-distributor-300775086.html) by Aphria in 2019.

&gt;it has been selected by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) to supply Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) certified medical cannabis products for experimentation in France. Tilray will supply GMP-produced medical cannabis products to serve patients in need for the duration of the French experiment (18-24 months), due to begin in the first quarter of 2021.

The cannabis will be exported to France from Tilray's facility in [Portugal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005184/en/Tilray%C2%AE-Receives-the-First-and-Only-Market-Authorization-to-Offer-Medical-Cannabis-Products-in-Portugal) 

&gt;In May 2020, Tilray received its third and complete Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification for Tilray Portugal. The complete GMP-certification allows Tilray to manufacture medical cannabis extracts in-house and export GMP-produced finished medical cannabis products, both dried flower, and oil, from Portugal throughout the European Union and other international markets with authorized national medical cannabis programs.

So i'm going to say upfront that I really hope that my analysis here is wrong. The fact that literally, NO ONE I've seen is talking about this indicates to me that I have to be wrong. But every way I look at it I come to the same conclusion. I'm really new to the investing game, but I have known about how financial markets and how the systems around them work since I was a kid though as my father is a trader for an oil company. So I'm not a complete idiot at least. A lot of this is parroted from other sources, some of which are even from reddit, though I have lost the posts I pulled from so I can't cite them. But I'm not INTENTIONALLY plagiarizing at least. I've posted about this in the wallstreetbets community but they are both idiots and so focused on the GME yolo train that they don't seem interested in anything else. I really hope that someone here can look at my analysis and point out where I'm wrong. So by reading and commenting you are doing me a huge favor so I appreciate it. I'm going to drop the TL;DR at the top and my evidence below.

TL;DR The behavior of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) of the last 20 years has created a market bubble with the value of the US Dollar. Their policies are based around constant and accelerating growth of GDP that is not a realistic goal from a practical perspective as even if there was the possibility of this there is always forces outside the market that affect GDP growth. (Such as a pandemic) As a result, the value of money in the economy is far far greater than the value of the actual dollars that exist. This has created a massive, if yet unseen, bubble that is bound to burst eventually with no real way for the Fed or the government to do anything about it. My expectation is that when this GME rocket goes off in the mother of all short squeezes we will see MASSIVE de-grossing and as a result a steep fall in the value of the stock market over all. Which will in turn cause a run on the banks just like what happened in the depression. When that happens the system will come completely unglued as since not only is there not enough cash on hand to give everyone, the debt backed by that money will no longer be collateralized so everyone is going to come knocking for their money. This sudden evaporation of ""money"" in the economy that's generated by debt will cascade and drive the value of the dollar to at or near 0. Triggering a global economic collapse.

The behavior of the Fed in the last 20ish years has been to progressively reduce the interest rate that they will loan money to banks to cover their minimum cash on hand amounts by law. This functionally increases the liquidity and availability of money in the form of debt as it allows the banks to make increasingly large amounts of loans for a profit. There's more going on under the hood than just the interest rate but it's historically the primary way that the Fed manages inflation and money supply. 

The Fed can't make large changes to the interest rate because to do so would not only shake confidence in the system but trigger amplification of the inflation/deflation effects on GDP, which in turn can further reduce the GDP due to decreased confidence by those with money to invest. You also don’t want to suddenly massively increase your money supply because this will amplify any effects increased money velocity has on inflation. Increased inflation will also lead to less savings and more people spending money as soon as they receive it. So gradually over time the Fed has decreased the interest rates to the point whereas of March last year they were effectively 0.

There is massive wealth inequality in the united states. This is not any new information to anyone. But why this matters is that a wealthy individual is far more likely to invest any money they get either through legitimate gains or through increased money supply by the fed than a ""regular"" person would be. This in turn makes it to where rather than circulating back into the economy as regular purchases of conventional goods like bread, milk, cheese, gas. etc. this money goes into investments such as the stock market. This is where the velocity of money comes into play. In short, the ""velocity"" of money is the rate at which it changes hands, usually due to the purchase and sale of real goods. Over the last 20 years the velocity of money has gone down dramatically as the wealth gap gets bigger and bigger.

The decreased interest rate has added more and more money into the economy through loans/debt. The new money supply, through loans, would be mostly issued for consumption, like a mortgage to buy a new house or a new car loan to buy a car. This will have the added benefit of increasing the velocity of money because this new money supply is recycled into the economy. After 2008, the Fed had to find a new mechanism, with interest rates being permanently too close to zero to have any meaningful impact on the money supply to actually help anything, especially since most Fed board members think that negative interest rates are a bad idea. With quantitative easing, direct purchases of treasuries artificially lowers the yields of treasuries and makes bonds and equities relatively more attractive when looking at risk / reward, inflating prices of those securities. We’ve effectively reached 0% yield on the risk-free-rate during the last crisis, so the next logical step for the Fed was to buy other securities, like commercial paper and now bonds. Except the biggest holders of treasuries and bonds were actually corporations and high-net-worth individuals, who compared to regular people have a much lower propensity to consume, and would not at all address the lowering velocity of money. It also leads towards higher wealth inequality, as it inflates prices of those securities, and all other financial assets which are concentrated at the top corporations and individuals, which tends to be bad for velocity of money. In simplified terms, the increase in money supply goes towards the people who already held a lot of wealth. This is probably why we’re seeing a steep drop-off of money velocity after 2008, even after the economy has recovered.

Then you throw a pandemic into this. Suddenly all the variables are changing rapidly with the economic shock of the effects of the disease. This causes a dramatic drop in the velocity of money. At the same time we're having the biggest sudden drop in GDP in history, at the scale of the Great Depression. The positive feedback loops mean that if the Fed is not able to expand the supply of money enough, we’ll quickly see a deflationary spiral. If they do too much, we quickly get into hyperinflation. The Fed has pretty much maxed out on everything they could have possibly done to keep inflation at 2% by increasing the money supply using tools they’re allowed to use. Interest rates and the risk free rate have been near 0% since 2008, and bond yields are already at unrealistic levels for the amount of risk they have, resulting in a skyrocketing increase in equities. Since none of these actually address the velocity of money issue, which has sharply decreased since March, we’re probably going to head towards a deflationary spiral.

This has lead to a situation where the true ""value"" of the money in the banks is way different than the value of the debt loaned out to the various parties buying assets in an effort to get greater returns on their investment than they would if they took a ""risk free"" stance. Hence the bubble. To put it another way, for every 1 ""real"" dollar in the banks there are many more dollars circulating in the economy/stock market due to collective debt and risk management.

The ""risk free"" investment of treasury bond's rate of return has reached effectively 0. So everyone is dumping their bonds, some of which aren’t even getting any bids when being sold, even briefly going into negative territory. Add on the fact that a substantial amount of non-US debt is denominated in US dollars, meaning governments and corporations around the world are trying to get their hands on USD to cover their debt payments with reduced revenue. The skyrocketing corporate bond yields make it virtually impossible for companies, even the ones with strong balance sheets, to raise their much-needed cash to survive through bond issuance.

How much longer can this last? Fed funds rates are already effectively stuck near zero; even in the “booming” economy that we’ve had the past decade the Fed was barely able to raise the repo rate past 2% before the stock market started crashing in late 2018 and was never able to meaningfully unwind their balance sheet from all the quantitative easing they did in the Great Recession. Now they’ve put their liquidity injection program on steroids with infinite QE. They’ve reduced the risk of corporate bonds by saying they will be the bag holder if things go bad.

The key takeaway here is that increased liquidity from the Fed causes inflation of asset prices. And at the moment we are at or near maximum liquidity in the economy due to the gradually changing economic policies by the Fed. In an effort to maintain constant ""growth"" of the economy during the financial recessions of 2008 and now 2020 the Fed has made the bar for banks ability to loan money (that they don't actually have mind you as they are using debt to do so) so low that with the effective 0% interest rate they can loan out as much as they want since they can just buy the reserve cash they are required to by law for a rate FAR lower than they can get the buyer of the loan to pay.

All of this has made the value of the single dollar in the bank is far less than the value it produces in the economy. Remember the bubble part from earlier? Well this is that but on a massive unprecedented scale. Now this could continue for a while and inflation will continue, but the velocity of money will continue to go down and the wealth gap will continue to increase. This increased gap in wealth has made it to where a greater and greater percentage of wealth is in the hands of investment groups like hedge funds which themselves operate off of taking both long and short positions to ""hedge"" their risk, which is thereby rewarded by increased ability to buy due to the confidence the banks/investors have in the hedge funds. So if you as a hedge fund have 1 dollar and your creditor gives you access to 10 dollars for your long positions as long as you promise to take a 10 dollar short position as well. This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk, but in reality your 1 dollar is exposed to 20 dollars worth of risk.

Then comes along wallstreetbets. They notice the massive overshorting of GME stock. They take this opportunity to trigger the mother of all short squeezes to spike the price of the GME stock and sell at the top for huge gains. In other words, as the meme stocks like GME go up the highly leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. This is called grossing / de-grossing and as a result of this massive sell off of other assets, be it stocks, bonds, commodities, what have you. Cause the price to drop. You can see this in the effect the GME thing has had on the overall stock market just last week. What makes this worse is that since the price of the GME stock has risen the financial market sees the short position as increasingly lucrative as once the squeeze is over if they can bear through it they will see great returns. This causes a feedback loop as the GME buyers buy more and more of the shorted stock the price rises, which causes the price of other assets in the stock market to fall. And since the GME stock is so over shorted there is theoretically no limit on how far this could go.

So when the short squeeze on GME begins there is going to be an unfathomably large amount of de-grossing causing the value of all other assets to hit the floor. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so if GME (and other common shorts) skyrockets the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis.

This would be very bad obviously. But to make it even worse, when the GME bubble does burst all the wealth that's been put into it basically disappears. If it were just major firms that were getting the gains from this they could conceivably reinvest in the now catastrophically low valued stocks. But as a practical matter this is unfeasible as the time between the GME rocket and the reinvestment the run on the banks will have already happened. Additionally, so many of these shareholders are now low net worth individuals and they are far more likely to ""consume"" such as paying off debt or charitable giving such as we've seen on the WSB subreddit already. The sudden decrease in net value of the stock market will trigger a panic and just like in the great depression a run on the banks. Which the bank obviously can't cover because they have loaned out so much of their money that they don't have even a fraction of the ability to return actual dollar bills to their customers. Making this EVEN WORSE the fact that the debt accrued by the banks is so overvalued when the stock market crashes all their loans become basically worthless so not only do they not have no cash on hand from the run on the bank, they don't have any means to recoup the losses from the loans.

All this to say, the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 20 years has artificially increased the supply of money without actually printing more money. As a result, the value of the stock market is several times greater than the companies that make it up are actually worth. This is going to see an economic crash not just on the scale of the great depression, but several times greater than that. Plus the ""bubble"" here is not tulips, or mortgage-backed securities, but of the dollar itself. So when this collapse happens the value of the dollar will become basically nothing. As the world's reserve currency this will trigger a worldwide collapse, which will trigger an international run on the banks, which will have their own problems respective to their economies financial policies.

I have NO idea how to stop this. If it weren't GME now, it'd be something else in the future, we're just seeing it now due to the massive acceleration of interest in the GME stock due to wallstreetbets and it's subsequent exposure to the main stream media. There aren't any tools left in the Feds toolbelt to get this under control. Even if the SEC froze all purchase/sales of the GME stock (which would be incredibly unpopular anyway) that would only be a temporary solution as eventually some other stock will see this problem and we'll have to go through it all over again.

This isn't just bad, this is apocalyptically bad. And that's not hyperbole. It could realistically cause the complete collapse of the global economy. There won't just be bread lines, there will be no bread for ANYONE to have.

My earlier mentioned trader father believes this will cause essentially what happened in the great depression. But this isn't a great depression. This is potentially the collapse of the entire system. During the depression, the stock market didn't hit zero. Not even close. Additionally, there is no ""gold standard"" to get off of like there was in the depression. ALL of our money is fiat currency and is only backed by our collective faith in the government to continue to exist. But that goes out the window now, no one will believe the government can pull us out of this.

If you've made it this far and think I'm missing something or have too few brain wrinkles then downvote the shit out of me. But I don't think my analysis here is flawed. I really, truly, and sincerely hope I'm wrong. If what I proposed here goes down it will be unspeakably bad. So seriously, if you have an alternative viewpoint or idea to help solve the problem. I'd LOVE to hear it.

Even if every member of WSB became a millionaire because of sick gains from GME, if that triggers the run on the banks and subsequent devaluation of the USD those millions of dollars might not even buy you more than a handful of tendies.

I'm fairly new to investing. I'm reading some recommended materials; reading A Random Walk Through Wall Street and listening to The Intelligent Investor. I've started trying to read through some earnings reports to learn a bit about the space and how to do my own research.

Some stocks of interest to me are the auto stocks; Toyota and Tesla to be precise.

My understanding is that the P/E is the price over earnings. This number doesn't seem to be handed out per stock. Some seem to automatically calculate it? How is this done? For instance if I google ""Tesla stock"" I get the P/E value of 1318. 

If I google ATT (T) I don't get a P/E value, which I assume means I need to calculate it myself from their earnings reports?

Also, playing with the numbers and trying to figure out how Tesla (a $730B market cap company) stands up next to Toyota (A $227B market cap company) I came up with the following:

    $835 / earnings = 1318.42
    earnings = $835/1318, which would be $0.63 per share (TSLA)

This is interesting to me. Because if we do the same for Toyota:

    $140.49 / earnings = 14.56
    earnings = $140.49 / 14.56 = $9.65 earnings per share (TM)

More interestingly, if I try and apply the PE of TSLA to Toyota, I get the following:

    1318 = price / $9.65 earnings per share
    1318 * $9.65 = price
    price = $12718.7

This would bring Toyota's market cap to $20.6T, which I think we probably all agree would be ridiculous?

The more interesting thing is I took Toyota's P/E and applied it to TSLA

    14.56 = price / $0.63 earnings per share
    price = $9.17

This would bring Tesla's market cap to $8.7B if my math is right. 

I guess the point of my post is to ask, what gives? Are PE values in excess of 1000 for large-cap companies ever justified? Speculatively, is this sustainable? Who is this value coming from? 

I'm far enough in the books I mentioned to understand that growth is an important part of the equation when valuing a company, but I'm really trying to make sense of this. In general everything in my logical being tells me Tesla's stock is way, way overvalued, but everything in my gut is telling me ""It doesn't matter"" and that it's going to continue rocketing, because when I'm out on the road, I see Teslas. My coworker making $70k a year? Tesla Model 3 Driver. My boss making a few hundred thousand a year (I'm a software engineer)? Tesla Model S Driver. My wife making a few hundred thousand a year? Tesla Model X driver. 

Toyota on the other hand has a lot more market share on overall cars. More people objectively drive Toyotas at the time of this posting. Even though Tesla's are becoming more common, and they seem to be ""affordable"" if you go with a Model 3, there are more Prius on the road at this point, I believe.

Some general questions:

* I have felt like I missed the bag on TSLA a few times. At what point does the market stop tolerating this? Isn't the idea on a growth stock that eventually the P/E will balance out? It doesn't feel like that will ever be the case on Tesla. Does this mean the future of a ""successful"" TSLA would eventually see a Tesla valued at a few trillion with a &lt;= 100 P/E ratio (which I still feel is high)?
* ""Who"" are the investors who have propelled Tesla as such? Most people I talk to about Tesla in general talk about how they can't afford to buy stocks at $300+ a share. Most individuals I know go the Random Walk route and invest in the S&amp;P, which I suppose ""indirectly"" invests into TSLA. I suppose I mean to ask, are these primarily retail investors, or hedge funds?
* Are there any previous Tesla's in history I'm missing? A Random Walk brings up the South Sea Company, and the Tulip Bulb Craze. I'm only 33, so I'm a bit curious if there's been anything like this before in that: Tesla IS successful, and it trades very high. Has anything in this situation ""failed"" before?

Pardon my ignorance on these topics. I am genuinely trying to learn some of the psychology behind this and would greatly appreciate others' 2 cents on the topic. I know Tesla as a stock is probably a controversial topic, so I tried to provide as much ""math"" as I could to back up what I'm saying.

Would it make sense to sell/write a call option at 3,00? I will receive 0.03/share in “interest?” (Dont know the english word but I think you get what I mean)

Scenario 1: It reaches 3,00, the one who bought my call option will exercise it and I sell my shares for 3,00 each, which I am satisfied with. I also pocket the  “interest”. 

Scenario 2: It stays between 2,70 and 3,00. I pocket the “interest” and keep my shares.

Scenario 3: The price falls below 2,70. I still keep the interest, but my shares are worth less.

Scenario 4: the price drops to 0. I lose all my money.

The stock in question is very stable and I dont expect it to plummet at all. Would such a strategy make sense or am I missing something completely? All feedback/criticism is welcome.

Newish investor here...my whole life I have seen people say it is hard to beat the SP500 over time, and that even Warren can't do it, but then I see a stock like Apple (over the past 20 years especially) and think, why couldn't/hasn't a stock like Apple beat it?

&amp;#x200B;

If you look at apples Returns in the past 20 years (even 25) it seems like if you're willing to wait 5 years there is a VERY LOW chance you're not making a shit load of money. Sure you can say pre 1998 there was some red years in there, but that was also before the iphone, ipads, and the tech boom...what am I missing here? I am not talking 100k, I am just sayin, if I have 5-7k I can invest...I could put in the SP and watch it double every decade....orrrrrr I could put it in apple and watch it quadruple? Obviously with a risk of one stock, you never know...but I guess my point of this is why does everyone say you can't beat the SP? Is that looking at 100 years of data, or what?"|investing|Apple vs SP 500|30.0|0.74
