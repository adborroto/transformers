    "Elasticsearch is hosted seperately to Python. It will run as a local server on our computer.\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install Elasticsearch. For this we need to head over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html) and install the correct version underneath **Installing Elasticsearch Yourself**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Elasticsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "To start an Elasticsearch instance, from inside the */elasticsearch-X.XX.X* directory we type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".bin/elasticsearch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*(You may have done this already when following through the **Installing Elasticsearch Yourself** steps for Linux)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*(For Windows, Elastic should have started automatically, but if not you should be able to find **elasticsearch.exe** in a directory like `C:\\Program Files\\Elastic\\Elasticsearch\\7.11.2\\bin`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's all we needed to do, Elasticsearch is ready to go."
